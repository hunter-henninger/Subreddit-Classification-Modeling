taoism,"Examples of characters with balanced archetypes, i.e. not too much yin or yang.","TL;DR at the bottom. I was listening to an episode of ""The Drunken Taoist"" podcast yesterday, and they were discussing how there aren't too many archetypal figures in popular media and history who embody the middle path between yin and yang. Most people we admire or want to emulate are either mostly yang or mostly yin leaning, due to our black-and-white/all-or-nothing cognitive biases. The podcast hosts couldn't think of any at that moment that were balanced. With that being said, I would consider Laozi or Chuangzi or any of the other Taoist sages cheating - they're already well-known to be in touch with Tao.

The hosts gave an example of a yin dominated story where Zen master Ryōkan encounters a thief in his hut, and the thief is taken aback because there's nothing to steal. Ryōkan feels sorry for him, because if he's resorting to theft he must be in a bad place and he might have a family he's trying to feed, and offers the thief one of his only possessions, that being the robe he is currently wearing. Ryōkan then proceeds to look up in wonder at the moon that same night, butt naked, and thinks to himself ""I wish I could have given that poor man this beautiful moon."" This is an extreme form of yin.

A good example of extreme yang would be Sun Wukong the monkey king from Chinese myth. Yes, the story becomes more balanced as it progresses with the introduction of more characters - but the character himself (Wukong) essentially remains yang dominated. He's also not a character to emulate (maybe in some ways and not in others), he's just an archetypal example I'm throwing out there.

Now someone who is balanced that immediately comes to my mind is Bruce Lee, but even he could have been considered a little more yang than yin (I'm probably wrong, I don't know many specifics of his life).

Maybe it's not possible and that's the point - we are typically dominated by one pole and the challenge is to incorporate and adopt ways of being from the other pole to be more wholesome.  

But I'm looking for specific examples of individuals who walk the middle path with grace and vulgarity. Compassion and aggression. Rigor and intuition. Vitality and lethargy. Not one or the other. 

TL;DR Who do you think of when you think of non-Taoists who walk the middle path?"

taoism,Wuji and Taiji,"Hi guys,

I've been a ""Taoist"" (in as much as that term can be used) for about 2 years now and I've managed to incorporate a lot of the ethical and practical philosophy of it into my life. However, its taken a lot of head-scratching to understand some things. Not necessarily in what certain concepts *mean* but what I am *to do* with these ideas. I.e. how do I practice Wu Wei in day-to-day life, or why should I meditate, how do I incorporate the idea of Ziran into my life? I've found answers to  these questions but something has been bugging me recently and I was hoping someone could maybe enlighten me on something.

There are the concepts of *Wuji* and *Taiji* and, as I'm sure you already know, they refer to ontological principals in Taoist, and to a broader extent, Chinese cosmology. Wuji meaning ""limitless"" and ""without ridgepole"". Its the formless, primordial state of the universe before there was a One. Taiji *is* that One, the ""great pole"", that undifferentiated one that contains the Yin and Yang. 

I've read in that in the order of creation that it goes Tao-&gt;Wuji-&gt;Taiji-&gt;Wu Xing (the five elements)-&gt;the myriad things. I've also read that Wuji and Taiji are interrelated, that the Taiji is essentially the Wuji in action and the Wuji is Taiji in stillness. I'm not sure my reading of that is correct but if it is would this make the Wuji and Taiji a higher version of Yin and Yang?. I'm well aware that reading only gets you so far in Taoism, so maybe just letting go of my attempts to understand why these concepts are important is what I should be doing.

My question is, what is the relation of these concepts to ourselves? Is this just a cosmological concept that really has no effect on how I should follow the Tao? Or is Wuji something I should try to align with in meditative practices? Am I making this a bigger deal in my head than it really is?. I really hope this made sense as its a bit of ramble, so thanks if you stuck with me and if anyone has any answers I'd be very grateful. "
taoism,Taoism - Detachment from overthinking? (I guess?),"Hi everyone
It's been a while since I posted here, i have been reading and trying to ""understand"" what I have to on my own as someone kindly suggested. I believe I have made a few improvements, most concepts used to annoy me out of my mind because I felt contradictions where everywhere but I have know learned that contradictions can exist mutually and believe this was a intellectual and spiritual understanding because for some reason I felt strangely relaxed and in peace with all for 2 or 3 days after I had come to that realization. However, I have started doubting more on what daoism is and what is it about, the contradictions I see and the complicated ambiguous concepts don't bother me anymore, I can actually read the Tao Te Ching without getting annoyed at how ambiguous it can be at times ahah although other kinds of doubts have risen. This brings me to present day: I feel like there is a lot on my mind and an overall sense of not knowing what to seek or where to go. I understand the Tao is technically nothing you seek or you think through but then if I let go of all that and don't think about what I have learned about taoism like for example the dance of opposites, then doesn't that just made away? If I forget about the concept of the uncarved block won't it fade away since I am not thinking about it anymore? I feel like to archieve true wu-wei I need to let go of all these concepts but if I let go of them I feel like I am letting go of what I have learned and therefore I am back at square one. Quite a contradiction there, guess Im not as over them as I thought ahahah
Any help is appreciated, I just ask you to answer and share no matter how helpful you think it's gonna be, some times a few words can go a long way."

taoism,Taoism in a nutshell,"Hi. i have been a Taoist for a while and i always find it hard to explain Taoism to  people in the simplest way. So i'm asking  how would you describe Taoism to people?

 Also what would you say is the main goal of this wondrous philosophy?"
taoism,Frugality,"I consider this trait one of the best traits a person can have (and smartest).  I also believe it is one of the 3/4 recurring principles of Taoist readings.  I live in the USA, pay my mortgage, bills, etc. and still struggle to find any balance of materialism **vs** indulgence **vs** necessity **vs** wants.  Financially, Taoism aside, it is good to put yourself at some semblance of financial safety (and your family's) so I see the benefits there.

But still, frugality is probably the hardest principle to achieve for me personally.  I only wanted to ask how some of you folks try to (or maybe do) strive for frugality?  

Is it just to minimize materialism?  Do you ""do without""?  Is it finding joy in different things?  Is frugality only relegated to money and *things?*"
taoism,This passage from Shakespeare's Hamlet,"Maybe some will disagree that this belongs here since this is from Western literature, but I've always found these lines from Hamlet very meaningful and they remind me to accept situations that are thrown at me in life, be they good or bad:

Not a whit. We defy augury. There's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come. If it be not to come, it will be now. If it be not now, yet it will come—the readiness is all. Since no man of aught he leaves knows, what is 't to leave betimes? Let be."
taoism,Wang Fuzhi: Every way is part of the Way.,"I'm reading Brook Ziporyn's *Zhuangzi: The Essential Writings,* which also features translated commentary from a number of Chinese thinkers. Here's Wang Fuzhi's commentary on Zhuangzi's chapter 2, in which Zhuangzi criticizes both the Mohists and the Confucians of his time.

Note that Ziporyn translates 道 (Tao) as ""Course,"" attempting to capture its Old Chinese senses of 'path,' 'way,' 'lesson,' or 'method of doing something.'

&gt;*Every affirmation affirms something. Every course leads somewhere.... Wherever the understanding consciousness may reach, all of it is within the Course. Some partial, some comprehensive, some left, some right, but every course can be seen as some part of the Course.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Those who limit themselves to their understanding consciousness, making it into a fully formed mind... failing to understand how both alternatives are always at once acceptable and unacceptable, instead considering only one way right and one way wrong - these people take the small completions and successes of their understanding and opinions and make them into a theory....*  
&gt;  
&gt;*\[The Confucians and Mohists\] contended with each other in order to ornament their honor and renown, and the Course was thereby obscured, along with the kind of words that affirm both alternatives....*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The Illumination of the Obvious \[以明\] is like the sun, and conscious understanding is like a lamp. The sun illuminates all without needing to be lit, but the lamp is sometimes lit and sometimes extinguished, and can only illuminate a single chamber, leaving in darkness whatever is far from the flame... Thus, the Confucians and Mohists all say they make use of illumination, holding fast to their little corner glow.*

I understand this to complement the first chapter of the Tao Te Ching (""*The name that can be named is not the Constant Name""*). Don't believe people who claim that their path is the *True Path*; don't be so quick to believe that their lamp is the Sun. Always keep an unformed mind that's always learning and growing and defying labels and categories.

The term ""*Illumination of the Obvious""* is a very strange translation for 以明 (yímíng). It's translated elsewhere as simply 'illumination,' 'enlightenment,' 'making use of light.'"
taoism,Understanding chapter 1 of the taoteching,"Tell me if I’m understanding this chapter correctly:

The tao cannot be named, because it is eternal. To name it would be to remove it from eternity as a single idea/manifestation, when it cannot be fixated on because infinity is infinite, I.e the term infinity or it’s definition (as we define it) cannot describe infinity in its entirety. 

The only way to realize (not understand) the mystery of the tao is to be free from the desire to understand it in a technical way, because this fixates us on individual parts of the wholeness/oneness. Meaning to relax into the understanding that I am here inside the tao, that I am the tao, and to take comfort and relaxation in that process. 

My physical manifestation and the eternal are both one in the same, so when Lao Tzu writes “darkness within darkness, the gateway to all understanding” I am to be like the tao, in that the tao does not try to manifest an understanding of itself (it cannot), so it just exists. It is. Much like I am. So when it says darkness within darkness, I am to be this darkness within the darkness (tao), where darkness represents a state of being free from the desire to understand the eternal oneness/wholeness. Thus realizing the mystery, of simply being here one with the tao. 

Is this a correct understanding of this chapter?

This is my new favorite movie. While I was watching it last night for the first time, it occured to me that it has some parallels with taoism.

The Omatacaya people seem to be very in tune with their version of the tao. They work in harmony with nature, while the humans try to conquer it. I had this thought during the scene where the Jake Sully is killing the animals in self defense and Neytiri becomes angry with him. In addition, their deity, Emya, works ""not on anyone's side, but to provide a balance in nature"".

taoism,The Sherarat,"Disclaimer: I'm not trying to make excuses for the way in which the Arabs organize their society, I'm just saying, don't let the word *slave* evoke a bunch of American ideas and imagery in your mind.

Lawrence goes on about Awad, his Sherarai camel boy I mentioned in the 'Peace in war' post, in an almost reverent way, that makes me want to be more like him.

&gt;...active as a cat, alive in the saddle (he rode magnificently) and in his savage eye an air of constant and rather suspicious expectancy, as though he looked any moment for something new from life, and that something not wholly grateful.  
The Sherarat were an enigma in the desert...harder living and more ascetic than any Bedouin. Often they spent years in the open without once visiting a market, existing on samh and dates, and camel milk from their prolific herds. They bred the best camel of north Arabia, and had a profound understanding of their care and treatment. They were brave fighters, though not for their own hand for they had no blood-enemies or tribal organization, but were split up all over the desert as helots among the Arabs. 
They were as Arabic as Arabia itself, and yet stood outside its society, and had no common feeling with its tribes. They were outcasts, and their extreme degradation was a positive base on which to build trust. **Other men had hopes and illusions. The Sherarat knew that nothing better than physical existence was permitted mankind in this world or the next**...good slaves they were for nothing in the desert was beneath their dignity, or beyond their strength.

taoism,Peace in war.,"Lawrence and a Awad (18 year old Sherari helot) set out to play scout-games with the Turks, as distraction so their camp is not discovered.

&gt;...wandered across the Maan highroad in order to draw the Turks' notice. When we had succeeded and they trotted out in chase we returned back, doubled again, and so tricked their mule-riders towards Aba el Adham. Awad took a gleeful concern in the game and handled his new rifle well.  
Afterward I climbed with thim to the top of the hill near Ageila, overlooking Batra and the valleys that sloped to Aba el Lissan, and we lay there lazily by the cairn till afternoon, watching the Turks riding in a vain direction, and our fellows asleep, and their pasturing camels, and the shadows of the low clouds seeming like gentle hollows as they chased themselves in the sunlight over the grassy levels. It was peaceful, chilly, and very far from the fretting of the world. The austerity of these great heights had shamed back the vulgar baggage of our daily cares. In the place of Consequence, it set Freedom, power to be alone, to slip the escort of our manufactured selves,; a rest and complete forgetfulness of being."
taoism,"Confusion, delusion, and the Tao","Since the first moment I glimpsed at the Tao te ching, I was amazed and knew there was truth therein. I'm so lucky to have found it. I have found it after a lot of years of other beliefs and thoughts. I was always drawn to the ""spirit"". But I think I was holding onto many things which are simply not real. I suffered a lot the past 6 years due to OCD and depression and I'm slowly recovering. But sometimes the Tao doesn't help with confusion! It is so confusing and I'm already confused... I want to understand the Tao better, to understand myself better. Is it a waste of time, talking about the Tao? How can we speak about it? Only through paradox. Only then I understand the mystery, it is unbelievable. Tao is magical, isn't it? It is the eternal infant hahaha! I can see the face there! So confused. But if Tao is the Father of all things, who is the Mother? What are these things that I see? I cannot express them in words. It ends in confusion."
taoism,Importance of individuality,"I think that it's important to emphasize the fact that you will hardly ever have the same experience as anyone else.

After all, the tao is a path we ultimately must discover alone. "

taoism,I have read many posts and comments in this subreddit and these are my thoughts,"The nature of taoism is very appealing to western minds. Ive seen comments that resonate with me, I also so many novice people, in glad you are here. My advice to those who are new to taoism is to read the Tao Te Ching, very slowly. To keep it in sight and read a few lines now and then. Whwn a line hits a chord within you, and you sense insight, stay with it, close the book, and write it somewhere and reflect upon it, until the insight sinks in, and makes an impact in your daily life."
taoism,The True Person of the Past,"Who can be called a true person?

The true person of ancient times did not reject the few, did not aggressively pursue success, and did not scheme to achieve a career.

In this way, even if they committed some excess, they needed no remorse. If they had some success, they did not covet things for themselves.

Therefore, they could climb heights without fear, dive into water and not get wet, plunge into fire and not be burned. It was because of their wisdom that they could rise above the false and enter the Tao as they did.

2. Ultimately, what is the difference between him and Alan Watts? In [a critique of him in this very sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/a0sx6g/what_do_you_think_of_alan_watts/ealhcvc/) it seems that it can be also applied to Osho.
(PS: I think I've found it. Alan says don't believe in him, while Osho says you have to be your own guru. The former encourages readers to have a skepticism on him, while the latter raise their self-esteem, and this is where everything goes wrong.)
3. Laozi said that ""A thousand miles journey starts with a single step"". At first I subscribed to it because it's about never giving up with an optimistic/romantic perspective, and I think that's why it becomes a quote. But when I read it in the context (chap 64), it seems that the quote is more like just stating the fact, with no emotion in there. We can say that he had [detachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment_(philosophy)) to what he said. Still, is using the romantic perspective fine?
4. And finally, is wuwei and non-wuwei the same? A person who is wuwei won't aware that they are wuwei, so their action will be non-wuwei. It's Laozi to say that the wuwei person will be critique as stupid, so a wuwei person will critique another wuwei person as stupid?"

If we continue to approach these events with  our linear thinking the disasters will only return stronger and  stronger.Of course this can also be applied to the individual  level.

taoism,On being eclectic,"Someone said to me you are an atheist, which I replied, no I'm not.

Then he proceeded to say, so you are a believer. And I said, no I'm not that either.

He said, so you are bullshitting me. I paused and gave him my point of view.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm both and none, I told. I don't believe in believing, therefore I hold a contradictory point of view when it comes to explaining things intellectually.

Explain further he said!

OK! So imagine there is a God. Can I be God? For most of the believers, God is omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient. Which for all practical purpose I call, it's Infinite. So for some religions, it is even a sacrilege to say I'm God or you are God, but it is acceptable to say God is in every little thing, he's everywhere. Or to say if you practice our practices you can be in the grace of God. Something on those lines, but you can never be God as if God is a person. He is he and you are you, and that's that. But recall that God is infinite. And he's everywhere. So suppose I have half of God in me and you another half. What is half of infinity? It's infinity, right? Even if I had one tenth of God, or a infinitesimal fraction. It doesnt even make sense logically to divide infinity, when expecting it to be in parcels useful to say, he's in everything and everywhere, but YOU ARE NOT GOD. So what part of my identity, my ego, exists? My identity is obliterated when put next to the infinite. So do I believe in God? Yes I believe in me and my surroundings enough to function. But I don't believe in believe, but I have to believe if I want to be alive, to function.

&amp;#x200B;

All this was a play in words, I said, and this doesn't even matter. It is only for entertainment purpose.

I continued to say, that there is no me, as I showed to you with this thought experiment, by being next to the infinite. And to pose this affirmation that there is no me, I need to have the opposite to compare, that there is a me, even if me is a phantasy. If me is a phantasy, then the first affirmation might be a phantasy. Therefore there is a mystery, a paradox. And for instance, the expression of good and evil is just one more artistic expression of the Infinite, which is nondual, which is the Tao.

The Tao he asked?

&amp;#x200B;

Tao is an ancient concept of nondualism manifested by dualistic aspects. So for me, duality can be understood, or better, played, with the intellect. Nonduality only by direct experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh that's very interesting, he said. Today I learned something new and fresh.

When I got home I looked it up and was amazed! I too learned something new that day. I'm quite eclectic."

taoism,Resolving Anger!,"To lash out in rage is to still lash out at yourself, creating problems that will require healing.

So if you have anger:

1. Don’t hold it in.
2. Don’t release it as pain.
3. Release it as acceptance.

Now acceptance has many levels since as you practice acceptance, you can release the anger long before it even boils up to become anger.

Long before anger: look towards your feelings, find the internal conflict (or external) and work towards acceptance. Taoism teaches that peace is the true warrior’s path. The sword while an option is never used with anger or you have lost from the start.

Firstly: Don’t remove all aspects of anger out of one’s life, it does serve some useful purposes. More importantly, at times you need some anger when dealing with other people. Occasionally you need to reflect anger with anger. For example, anger is used at times as communication. Look at the wolf snarl above; it isn’t anger as an action, it’s a statement of communication to indicate position. The wolf is saying: “I am willing to fight to retain my place.” The wolf doesn’t want to fight; in fact, it’s trying to release the need to fight, with its snarl.

However, I preach that 80 to 90% of anger is wasteful."
taoism,How do you deal with conflicting ideas in taoism?,So this was pointed out by a user on the subreddit yesterday and it kind of makes sense. Chinese philosophy in general seems pretty conflicting with itself. For example: To be free from desire is by itself desiring. That's quite the antithesis so I was wondering what are your thoughts and opinions on that.

taoism,Is there any introductory academic text that discussing Taoism?,"I have read the essential TTCS and ZS (not full of them yet), and I'm looking for other texts that is more structured and more modern than those. I wonder how Taoism interacts to other schools of thought, like:

- Buddhism
- Hegelian dialectics
- Wittgenstein's ""the limit of my language is the limit of my world""
- romanticism
- postmodernism.

A quick question: if the nameless lives forever, then why are we in reddit and talk about it? If Laozi and Chuang Chou live in the present, what would they do?"
taoism,Taoism and my lazy colleagues,"What would a daoist do in this situation, how should I act?
So I am in 3rd year college engineering degree and we have some group assignments in different disciplines. Well on one of the discipline I got pulled into a group I didn't really wanna be in but as I usually do when things dont go my way I just give it a chance it doesn't bother me that much. First assignment comes in and nobody lifts a finger, nobody takes initiative. I have to be the one and I don't mind that too much but when I try to delegate work they all make excuses that they have a lot on their plate. I end up doing everything alone and we actually get a good grade. Even in this situation, I wasn't mad or anything a bit annoyed and disappointed but I ended up letting it go but I did tell them: next assignment we gotta delegate work and they all agree since their schedule was going to be less chaotic and they would have time to do it and also they were ""really sorry"" that I had to do it all alone. Next one comes around and only one of my colleagues actually works. I do my part, he does his, but I had decided by then I wasn't going to be pushed around so i just do one of the topics  (there were 3 topics, we were 4 elements) and then I rest and don't worry about it anymore. Well the two members that were supposed to finish the assignment leave all the work to the last day and begin fighting  a lot about delegating work and both talk to me complaining about the other one for being lazy. Now as you can see this is a huge lack of respect for the work I have done before, they are both complaining and wanting things to be fair whilst forgetting the huge unfairness that was me doing the first assignment all by myself.
I didn't directly confront them because at this point  I am just really tired of all the nonsense but I feel like they don't quite get how childish immature and disrespectful they were. I am really disappointed and this makes me angry but that flows away, what's worse is that it makes me sad and I don't know why. They manage to finish it past the time we were supposed to deliver it and there is apparently a bunch of mistakes (they told me that with a sad face, I haven't actually checked it out)of the. I was really peaceful yesterday while they were talking shit and fighting I was actually at  peace aahah but today I had class and had to see them and kinda felt bad again I don't even know. How would a daoist act? What would your personal course of action be? Any input is helpful, keep.in mind I am not asking for advice on what to do now, I don't even want to touch the subject with them anymore but I wanna know what you would have you done.

Also keep in mind ""telling the teacher"" isn't really an option since it's college and most of my teachers don't really care.

Thanks for reading and I'm sorry if I complained too much ahah"

taoism,School Project,I need help with a school project pretty bad. I’m supposed to have a conversation between a leader and his subordinate and play both roles.

Problem with this is as far as I am aware there is no real hierarchy in Taoism as it is heavily rooted in anarchy and spontaneity. Is anybody here immersed enough in Taoism to tell me how I may be able to do this?
taoism,A question about the Tao and morality I guess,"Hi everyone
I was wondering about something has of late. If the tao is natural and Tao comes when you don't use effort then why is desire something not effortless? I mean sometimes when for example we get angry or afraid we experience those feelings and that's natural and comes instinctively but when we act on it, for example if we yell at someone. Why is that not according with the Tao? Wasn't it a natural reaction?

EDIT: When I speak of effort and effortless action I don't mean it as like ""do nothing"" but more of an action with no friction with the way things flow."

taoism,Wealth is bad. Why? How to avoid 'accidental' resistance?," 'Amass a store of gold and jade, and no one can protect it(9).' Why wealth is considered bad by Li Er? Looking at rich people I cant say their security trouble them that much. More of poor people are scared of not being able to pay the bills or afford medical treatment they need to survive. We have banks, guards, insurance, police - a fair payment for your safety. Isn't it better to mourn the lack of wu-wei in your life, sitting on a back seat of your limo, than being broke and watching bailiffs taking away your TV - but with a taoist smile: 'Hope, it is the last time I see you here, boys, because the only valuable thing left in my house is my cat'?

How can one avoid 'leaving ripples' on water, if sometimes the very fact of your existence or your appearance/habits make people mad. Being second in the queue, you can be hated by the third person in that very queue. And by the looks of Laozi's teaching, he tries his best to avoid resistance.

taoism,Advice from a Taoist Perspective on how to deal with a particular Work Situation.,"I've begun learning about Taoism as well as reading books about it. Though I'm posting here because I'd appreciate getting advice about my situation from a Taoist Perspective. I've made mistakes in my life of surrounding myself with bad people that still affect me to this day. They lied and made rumors about me based on an event that occured in my life.  I try not to let these things affect me but one day I heard some co-workers gossipping as I showed up to my desk and immediately they stopped talking. After that many close co-workers, bosses, and higher ups who I thought I was close to began giving me the cold-shoulder and stopped talking to me completely. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some would be fake-nice, i.e. talk to me then gossip behind my back. You might ask why I didn't speak to my boss over what I heard my co-workers gossiping about but it would've been difficult to speak to my Supervisor and Human Resources about this as it's not topic to typically discus.  Other people I worked with began giving me menacing looks like they wanted to fight me. I feared that I was going to get into a fight and it would have a negative effect on my career so I left. I know that at my last job others would think that by leaving it made it look like I was implicating myself but I just wanted to avoid a situation that could turn dangerous. I've tried getting in touch with some old co-workers who I was close with but no response.  Even my old Supervisor who loved my work use to always leave me references. Now, any staffing agent working with me tells me they didn't hear from her. To get a new reference they can call.  Back to my old work environment, I shouldn't have left my old job abruptly but on one end I had fear that I was going to get into a fight,  I don't think it's fair that others talk about me behind my back and don't hear my side of the story. Being at work felt fake and insincere, I don't like working with others where there's this vibe/climate of insincerity and fakeness.

 

I read a quote from Lao Tzu stating that if you live your life according to other's throughts, you will always be their prisoner. Though it was difficult for me to go about my day because I like being and working with honest, sincere people because it feels right and just. I understand that this can be a very strict maybe even bone-headed way of looking at the world but growing up I always had this sense of Righteous Indignation. My issue is, how do I deal with those old co-workers if I ever see them again say when I'm hanging out with friends or relatives? I know they'll gossip about me but how do I go about being in situations where I'm dealing with fake people? I don't like dealing with the insincere aura/tension looming over the conversation but how can I deal with it without making the encounter awkward? I just want to go about my life working with the Tao and hopefully finding peace with myself. Though dealing with insincere individuals is difficult for me.

how not to go astray!

Maybe my ears don’t work right,

or my feet are lame.

Yet I have ears to hear,

and feet to walk —

each day I hear of the Way

and walk some path,

meandering though it may be.

They say if you are lost in the wild

and wish to walk straight,

with no landmark in sight:

spend half your time walking backward,

or your dominant leg will lead you in circles.

It seems we all walk backwards,

with only an idea of what’s ahead.

How can I correct my course?"
taoism,Thoughts on Personal Tao Book my Casey Kochmer,"I finished reading this book last week and I really appreciated how it gave me this beginning feeling and essence of flowing with life, the Tao, and ultimately learning how to be. The way Casey used his Poems (Which he's very Passionate about), art, and philosophy on explaining how he lives his life really resonated with me. Also what different aspects of life such as love, death, and understanding from his view are in relation to the Tao made me appreciate how I can live my life being and how I should see these different aspects of life. I wanted to see with you all if you've read this book and your thoughts on it. In case anyone is interested in reading it, I've posted the link below.

taoism,Yin and Yang," An important first step toward attaining this experience of interconnectedness is by learning to recognize and align ourselves with the movement of life itself. This is achieved through an understanding of yin and yang. This principle lies at the very root of the Taoist tradition and describes the underlying unity of life through the interplay of two primal forces. 

 Yin and yang are the two essential and interdependent energies of life. Though opposite in nature, they are not experienced as diametrically opposed, but rather as complementary and relative to one another. They arise from a common source, the Tao. Yang is characterized as creative, assertive, positive, and light, while yin is receptive, yielding, negative, and dark. It is important to note that these attributes are only descriptive and do not carry any moral value. 

 It is yin and yang that make the world go round! Our entire physical reality is based on the interplay of these two energies. Whether it is the structure of DNA, with its positive and negative strands, the transmission of neurons in our brains, from a positively charged sender to a negatively charged receptor, the existence of the earth’s magnetic fields which regulate the ebb and flow of the ocean tides, or the makeup of electricity with its positive and negative currents - all of these processes take place because of these two opposing energies. Their interaction creates all manifestation. It is through them that the Tao reveals itself. 

 The original meaning of the term “yin-yang” signified the dark (yin) and light (yang) sides of a mountain. Early in the day, the sun would illuminate one part of the mountain while the other side would remain dark. As the sun moved across the sky it gradually began to light the opposite side while the earlier sunlit face became dark. Light and dark were not static but interacted with one another, defined one another, and actually assumed each other’s roles in the process of change. This describes the interplay of yin and yang.

taoism,Taoist music,"Music is a big part of my life and I love it a lot. I’ve spent countless hours listening. One thing I really love and care about are the lyrics in my music. I have found that meaningful lyrics make songs much better and I have thus listened a lot to meaningful songs( not always). As I have become more immersed in Taoism I have come to appreciate this even more and I have realized that certain artists have certain songs that are very Taoist. For instance, I listen mostly to rap, and rappers such as j Cole and logic will occasionally make music that speaks many Taoist truths and holds Taoist ideas. J Cole made a whole album about our need to escape from the world through pleasure and how we should meditate instead. Logic speaks on doing what we love regardless of society’s ideas. He’s even had an Alan watt lecture on one of his closing songs for an album. What I would like to know is if there are any other songs that you guys feel entail Taoist ideas. Rap is preferred but i like everything. I’ll also listen to any songs you guys just like that aren’t Taoist cause why not. 
I’d encourage you guys to listen to songs like africaryan or maybe FRIENDS by Jcole. Let me know some songs:)

Edit: basically tell me some Taoist songs to listen to, or songs you like."
taoism,"I read someone use the verb ""to live""","I thought it curious that ""to die"" is to go from life to death, yet we consider ""to live"" as just being alive.

We should actually see ""to live"" as going from death to life just as ""to die"" is life to death.

You must be alive in order ""to die"" and so you must be dead in order ""to live""

Thus, in order to die one must live, then to live one must die, and so on and so forth. Like two coy-fish, one enveloping the other. A dance."
taoism,Tao,"I have been reading Tao: The Watercourse Way, great book so far. It has helped me grasp some of the inicial concepts one needs to start being aware of the Tao.
I was wondering: My intrepertation is that Tao is essentially everything. From every object to every action or emotion Tao is all of it and all of it arrises mutually and without distinction. If Tao is everything that happens then why do we talk about ""going against the flow"" or ""going against the Tao or the way""? Would it even be possible to stray away from it?
Hopefully some of you can help me clarify this question I have, thanks a lot.

EDIT: I realize there probably isn't a real clear answer for this for the Tao can't really be described as an entity and therefore it becomes hard to conclude anything specific about it and in my opinion that's also the beauty of it all. However I would appreciate any idea about my question, everything is helpful in one way or another."

taoism,How can one become fearless of suffering?,"I recall Alan Watts saying something like ~ “being afraid of suffering is the essence of suffering itself”.  

But how can anyone break that loop?

Let’s say there’s a fire and life’s secret is engulfed within it. Here you have 2 options:

1. Walk into the fire, engulfing yourself, suffering unimaginably yet gaining the very thing you seek most. 

2. Staring at the fire, paralyzed from fear, suffering acutely which becomes chronic and debilitating, and you don’t gain what you seek most. 

Overall, number one seems like the obvious choice, but as a humans it’s not so easy to actively use your willpower to choose something like that when you’re always afraid of suffering itself, in all its gruesome forms. 

So, what can be done? I’d prefer less vague philosophical cliches such as “who’s doing what?” or “who’s gaining/suffering”, and more practical Taoist responses that can be applied directly to the life of a suffering individual, because regardless of if the self/ego is an illusion, suffering exists, there is suffering. However, if you need those cliches to drive your point home feel free. "
taoism,being the best,"to many people seem to think that if your not going above and beyond, your being lazy, even your giving minimum effort + 1"
taoism,Emotions,"Handling emotions is an incredibly difficult process. Emotional distress creates conflict and slows a person’s healing process. Much of healing others comes down to helping a person learn how to get past and work with emotional turmoil.

  

**What Are Emotion?**

Emotions are the Velcro that keeps us in our stories. When you’re feeling emotional, you’re feeling an attachment to a story. This leads to some very interesting truths.

**1) Emotions change relative to the story they are within**

 So example, the love you feel for your partner will be different than the love you feel for your parents and different than the love you feel for your friends. It’s love each time, but the story itself changes the emotion very profoundly. 

**2) Emotions are more than in your mind**

We store emotions in our muscles. Hormones and pheromones change emotional responses. Emotions have a bio chemical component in addition to being mental processes. As an example: if you get hit, the pain and fear of getting hurt gets stored in the muscle and body where you were hit upon. This is why for more serious work in handling emotions, I have my students exercise, dance and when possible get a massage. Emotional responses are also stored in how and the style with which we express and tell our stories.

**3) Emotions add depth to your experiences**

Emotions add richness and persistence to your efforts. Without our emotions, we wouldn’t push through the more difficult challenges in life. When we approach something emotionally, we dig and dive into that process much deeper. The difference between failure and success are often within the emotional response. This knife cuts both directions of course, but without emotions, we wouldn’t be here now. Learning how to work emotionally is far more than simply removing all your clingy responses. "
taoism,Questions about the meaning of a Tao Te Ching Chapter,"I was reading through my copy of the Tao Te Ching and came across this chapter which seemed strange to me.
This is taken from Chapter 5 of the Red Pine translation:


""Heaven and Earth are heartless

treating creatures like straw dogs

sages are heartless too

they treat people like straw dogs

between Heaven and Earth

how like a bellows

empty but inexhaustible

each stroke produces more

talking only wastes it

better to protect what's inside""

Please keep in mind I'm fairly new to Taoism as a whole so I'm likely misunderstanding much of this.

The idea of sages treating people like a straw dog seems strange to me. This comes across as only seeing people as tools in the moment, or as not holding any respect or appreciation for them past their usefulness. I've often seen the sage represented as someone who is very kind and ""full of heart"" in the sense that they have loving tendencies.

The second thing about this chapter, and this one is pure confusion and not preconception on my part, is the last two lines of it. Red Pine adds comments on every chapter clarifying specific meanings, but they didn't elucidate these lines in a way that was very clear.

Again, lots of these concepts are still relatively knew to me, and people I know and can learn from personally regarding this subject are few and far between. If anyone can help me with these concepts I would really appreciate it, and thank you for reading this!"
taoism,"My thoughts on the how ""useless"" Tom Bombadil from LoTR is and why he's a Taoist Immortal","I think the whole point of Tom Bombadil is a lesson in the Taoist Principle of the ""usefulness of uselessness"" put forth by Chinese Philosopher Zhuangzi.

""A tree, he says, that is all straight, perfect and standardized is usually the first one to be cut down by a carpenter. So, its usefulness sooner or later proves to be fatal as it attracts those who are looking to take advantage of its utility. On the other hand, the crooked, wayward, capricious or outlandish tree is useless and will be overlooked. And because it will be left alone it will have the chance to grow. As it grows, it will provide ever more shade and tired travellers will start seeking it out to relax at its feet. And over time it will turn into a stunning example of natures abundant glory. It is thus that quite often a “useless tree” eventually becomes an object of sincere devotion.""

Tom is, within his own domains, essentially omnipotent. The ring has no power over him. He's self driven and self directed. He hangs out with Goldberry. Life is good if you're Tom Bombadil. But wait...

Elrond literally says he ""forgot"" about Tom Bombadil. Tom Bombadil, who has been around literally since creation. As far as has been explained, he was the first being on Middle Earth. He was around for all five of the great wars, likely familiar with the Ainur and the Valar, and yet...his global impact is ZERO. he doesn't take a stance against darkness. He doesn't take a stance at all, actually. He just IS.

The only beneficial thing Tom Bombadil does in Middle-Earth history is release the hobbits from the tree and from the Barrow Wights. I'll concede that the Barrow Wights thing was kind of a big deal, but Tolkien could have easily had someone else get them out. Doesn't matter.

Tom is useless, and overlooked, and (i suppose most importantly) immortal! He's so good at not giving a shit that he's lived forever and will continue to do so. I think that makes him a Taoist Immortal.

taoism,The Watercourse Way - Book,"Hello, I have heard this might be a good book to elucidate a few of the more complicated concepts one finds when beggining to learn about taoism. I'd like to read however the libraries and book stores where I live do have it, at least the ones I have gone to and Amazon isn't really an option for me. Does anyone know where I could purchase an ebook? Audible doesn't have it either so I am kind of running out of options
I'll check out another bookstore tomorrow but I am not expecting much there"
taoism,Happiness And Anger - My Thoughts On It,"I have recently begun to learn about taoism and one of the concepts I was having trouble with was relating equilibrium between the yin and yang and emotions. I always wondered why is happiness was regarded as a good feeling to have and anger for example (or hate or fear...) regarded as undesirable and things that we don't want. When I say this I don't mean in the literal sense for emotions aren't inerently good or evil but we still make the conscious decision to breath deep and calm ourselves down when we get angry. I then though ""Well, if all things are in balance then why isn't anger part of my life the same way happiness is? Why is feeling angry something I should overcome in order to live a joyful life?"". This is one of the things that confuses me the most in taoism and I have read great arguments and analogies from a few people here on the subreddit that really helped me but I still wasn't satisfied. Then I had this though: The reason why we are comfortable feeling happy, is because happiness is usually in accordance with the flow of things. We don't usually feel happiness because of things that aren't, only things that are. However, when we get angry, when we hate, when we fear, all these emotions are born from the desire of a different situation then the one we are in at the moment. If I'm angry because my car broke down then I'm angry at the universe for being the way it is, the way it flows. That is why anger for example is a forced action against a current state which the universe flows into. There is no point on being angry. 
The same thing happens when we get happy towards things that aren't. If I am really looking forward to an event or a way things will go in my head then I argue that that's not compliant with the tao for it's not a manifestation of the present but we are dwelling in the future that will never come for when it does arrive is no longer future.
What's your opinion on all this? Writting it all down and reading your comments really makes me understand all of this better and I think thats great"

They move around obstacles like water instead of moving them out of the way like a bear moves skinny and weak trees. They don’t require you to spend any money on stuff like toys or anything to keep them busy (unless you want to of course) like birds or dogs do. They’re never very busy. They’re home is almost in it’s natural state, compared to a beavers dam. They dont need very much attention. That’s all i can think of right now"

taoism,What do you think of Alan Watts?,"I enjoy listening to him but always with a grain of salt, he does make some comparisons and generalizations I sometimes don't really see or agree with but overall I think he has entertaining work that can sometimes help you understand some of the more complex but yet basic ideas of taoism and Chinese culture. For example, I had a hard time understanding the concept of Wu Wei and one of his lectures helped me quite a lot on that regard.
I wonder what's your opinion on him and his work, wether you have been in contact with his lectures or books or both.
(I have only really heard the lectures on YouTube, read 1 chapter of the his book the one about zen)"

taoism,Gifts that are not useful?,"It happens to everyone time to time.

You might have a friend that's a hunter and they give you a fir rug; or someone at the office might give you alcohol; or maybe it's a nick-knack and you're trying to de-clutter.

It could be rude to refuse a gift. But they may also see it as rude if you give it to someone else or donate it at a later time.

Would it better to pretend to like something as to not hurt someone's feelings?

What would you normally do if it's something that you can't make use of?

&amp;#x200B;

Just musings on a boring Monday. Gratitude aside as well, I understand that a gift is a gift for a reason. The person spent time thinking of you and you should acknowledge that."
taoism,All things and desire,"I'm new to taoism and having a hard time understanding what is and isn't desire. How do you relate hate, anger, confusion to desire and happiness not? I am aware some ""happiness"" could appear to come from desire for example I really want to buy a new car, I desire it and I buy it. Was that an action that is not according to the dao? I guess my theory would be the action itself is natural as long as it generates true happiness, however you shouldn't get caught up or obsessed on buying the car. The problem with this mindset is I always end up feeling guilty for feeling happy because I think ""Why am I happy and contempt with it if yesterday I got angry and my reaction was to try and let the anger go?"" Why is happiness better than anger in the way that one would be regarded as natural and the other not.
I know there is an idea that anger and happiness are both the same in taoism and things are only what we call them but that's not my intrepertation of the philosophy.
I'd appreciate any kind of helpful words! "
taoism,Is Taoism just another form of religion? Delusional and fake?,"If the Tao is the origin of all things, how can anyone not be in a state of accordance of the Tao? Even genocide is in accordance with the Tao because it originated from it. So everyone is in a state of Wu Wei because that is the only state that exists. So what is the point of promoting Wu Wei? The teachings of Lao Tzu are contradictory in some ways. How can one experience the true Tao if everything is an illusion? And so if we can’t experience the true Tao how can we assume it is real? Is Taoism the same as every other story of the world? Is it all just nonsense?"

taoism,western Taoist books,what are some good western Taoist books other then the tao of Pooh and the teh of piglet (already read them)
taoism,The wei wu wei of evolutionary oncology,
taoism,Tao and Happiness,"First of all I'd like to introduce myself, I'm new here and pretty new to taoism, I have been reading about it for only about two months and I came across a few questions naturally. One of the things that makes me ""uneasy"" about it is that I can't seem to grasp the concept of a taoist being happy or tranquil all the time. Shouldnt a taoist have a balance of emotions, since equilibrium in the world is such a focus point of taoism why isn't it more inclined to experiencing both sides, yin and yang. I always feel taoism is more inclined towards the good aspects of life, the yang, than the you which kinda defeats the porpouse of the balance of things.
I know I'm am probably missinterpreting the whole thing so could anyone please clarify this or at least point me I the right way? Im opened to everything!"
taoism,Taoist advice on uncertainty and impatience relating to my situation.,"It's been almost a year since graduatong and it's been rough to say the least.

Anyways I moved to NC with my grandparents to find work in my field (finance) and it hasn't been very good. 40k in loans doesn't help either. After brefily working in a wells Fargo office as a temp who was fired along with 100 others, I realized I have not my h interest in finance work.

I have myself until Thanksgiving to find a job or I'd move down to ATL with my father. Mostly because I felt like I was wasting time running in circles and maybe it was time for another change.

(Un) fortunately I found a job at Costco...i really don't like it too mu h being on my feet but the pay is alright and it's only seasonal for 2 months.  The uncertainty and impatience comes from it feeling like I'll never find my place in the world or a career path that is enjoyable and fulfilling...not true but if not now then when? 

I just realized it hasn't even been a Monyh at Costco and I'm already ready to quit it and move...almost as a way to expedite the change I want...that wouldn't be good cause I'd be back at square one trying to stretch out my last paycheck.

I used an I ching app and it says I should wait, which is a no Brainer lol. It's hard trying to find any good in this besides the pay being better than most retail Jobs though."
taoism,"How can I maintain self balance, Qi and harmony when interacting with a different balance?","People we interact with will have different levels of balance and different Qi, I find this often affects my own balance and my own Qi. Rebalancing can take a very long time and often by the time I feel restored it becomes disrupted again. For example by selfishness, unkindness, omnipotence, rudeness etc. How can I maintain self balance in these situations?"
taoism,my Taoism,"i believe in western Taoism, except i follow the Tao as both a way of life and the laws of the universe, as well a purely conceptual god. like the only part of it that you can describe is it’s personality"
taoism,Achieving Full Harmony,"&gt;Duke Ai asked, “What do you mean by achieving full harmony?”  
&gt;  
&gt;Confucius said, “Life and death, profit and loss, failure and success, poverty and wealth, value and worthlessness, praise and blame, hunger and thirst, cold and heat— these are natural changes in the order of things. They alternate with one another like day and night. No one knows where one ends and the other begins. Therefore, they should not disturb our peace or enter into our souls. Live so that you are at ease, in harmony with the world, and full of joy. Day and night, share the springtime with all things, thus creating the seasons in your own heart. This is called achieving full harmony.”

taoism,This is a relevant chapter of the Tao in the current political climate.,
taoism,"How do I, ""get out of my head?"""," 

""You never really relaxed. You seemed stiff the whole time. It was like you waaaay overthought everything. You need to stop thinking and start simply feeling.""

This is what my friend told me when we went to a cuddle puddle together. He is trying to get me, ""Out of my shell."" He is trying to get me to, ""Loosen Up,"" or, ""get out of my head."" So, he invited me to these various unrelated closed new age-ish non-religious groups. Some of them involved eye gazing, telling strangers your emotions, or dancing around a fire without abandon.

Writing idiomatically, I understand, ""solve for x,"" thinking. I understand algorithmic thinking. Like, when I clean a house, I have a checklist that I visualize/imagine like a heads up display in my vision. When I change lanes, I always signal, look at relevant side mirror, check behind me for blind spot, turn. When I have a conversation, I follow the FORD model for small talk. Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams. There is more to this algorithm. For manners, I follow, ""Daisy Eyebright's, ""A Manual of Etiquette on Politeness and Good Breeding."" I pay attention to the corner of peoples eyes/mouth for reading facial expressions.

Question: What the heck is this mystical/magical, ""get out of your head?"" How does someone like me practice such intuitional thinking? How do people, ""feel,"" what to do next instead of follow a pattern or a process?

I tried meditation, journaling, and these other activities, but I don't see how they do anything. When I meditate, I can turn off words/mind-pictures, and I can just listen to the sounds around me, the emotions in me. However, it doesn't help me know what to say in a conversation, or know what to do in a cuddle puddle."
taoism,Some questions about your dreams,"Hi,

I  once asked on AVEN (asexuality.org) how non-binary vs. cis vs. trans people dreamed and  what their bodies look like in their dreams and there seems to be some  differences, I'm curious about you guys. I am unsure as to whether I am  non-binary, agender or female.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been asking these questions on many different subreddits to compare.

&amp;#x200B;

I dream in an unusual  way, as I dream of myself in 3rd person (I see my body in 3rd person like I   am watching myself in a movie). Occasionally I swap between 1st and  3rd  person at will. I always know I am dreaming.

Here are some questions, I will reply to them below:

1. Do you know you are dreaming during your dreams?
2. What   POV/perspective do you dream on? (first person, third person, other    persons POV, not present/ feels like watching a movie, alternate    between perspectives, etc...)
3. Do you feel any physical sensations in your dreams?
4. Are your dreams usually realistic or surreal?
5. Do you have ""super powers"" in your dreams? (ie flying, breathing underwater, invulnerability, etc...)
6. Is your dream body different from your real one? If so, how so?
7. Do    you have any dreams where you start out as yourself (or someone     else)  then swap into someone else's body and see the body you were     before  through their eyes, then swap back again, and so on, and do you     ever see  sometimes both people at the same time in 3rd person? Do  you    alternate  between controlling either?
8. Do you control your actions in your dreams? Do you have any degree of control over your dreams?
9. How fast does time go by in your dreams? Is it like waking life, faster, or like a movie?
10. What is your sexual orientation and gender identity? (I think this manifests itself in dreams)

My answers:

1. I always know I am dreaming.
2. Usually   3rd person (I see myself from outside of my body while still    controlling it), sometimes 1st person, occasionally alternate, rarely I    am not present and I am just an observer and I remember having at  least   once ""possessed"" another person's body and controlled them.
3. No, I don't feel anything.
4. They are quite surreal.
5. Yes,   I can fly/float in the air sometimes, breathe underwater and I am    usually invulnerable. I can also rewind and change the future sometimes    and change the scene when the dream takes a turn I don't like.
6. Usually   my body is the same, but I dream of myself often in the body of  other   women, in a male body, in the body of some videogame character, as  a   fictional character or actor, some animal, etc... I often alternate  in   the same dream.
7. Not that I remember. When I swap bodies my body usually disappears.
8. I can control my actions fully, and the environment to a degree.
9. In   my dreams time seems to go by faster than normal. My dreams are  usually  long and lots of things happen. I can fill 2+ pages just with  keywords  when I wake up (I keep a dream journal and when I wake up I  just write  down the keywords to help me remember)
10. Female, hetero-romantic asexual.

What are your experiences? I think it would be interesting to compare."
taoism,"Isn't homosexuality against the Tao? If not, why?","Surely the same and the same cannot reproduce. The Tao is focused on the Yin and Yang, not Yin and Yin or Yang and Yang, they must both be different and opposite. Homosexuality focuses on two of the same, thus reproduction cannot occur, the cycle of life cannot continue and so it is AGAINST the way of the Tao.

As a Taoist, this is my view on the matter. I am eager to hear other's opinion and responses to this."
taoism,Dreaming I was a demon - A cartoon short story about acceptance," I'm attempting on making a YouTube Channel where I'm going to make cartoons about the dualistic perception of nature and contemplation of non-dualism and what that implies.

taoism,Wu-Wei and trying not to try,"When I am flowing or in a state of Wu-Wei life seems to move smoothly. When I am not in Wu-Wei and realize it, the self-talk I engage in makes it hard to just reengage in a state of flow and Wu-Wei.

  
Does anyone have any thing they say to themself to help them reengage with the Tao, to flow with life, and to help them Wu-Wei? 

&amp;#x200B;

Or--is talking to yourself and trying to flow the exact opposite of what I should be doing? As in, am I trying not to try and making it impossible to flow?"
taoism,Arbor Day,"Ok so i really like the idea of arbor day. Despite the fact that it's a secular national holiday, is there any tao to be found in this holiday."

taoism,"Question about the sage in Horses’ Hooves, Zhuangzi Ch.9","Who are these sages that are being referred to in this Zhuangzi passage? I’ve gotten used to seeing the sage as someone to be emulated in much of Zhuangzi and Laozi. Here I’m not sure who he is referring to. 

Excerpts from Chapter 9, Martin Palmer translation:

&gt;	In this time of perfect Virtue, people live side by side with the birds and beasts, sharing the world in common with all life. No one knows of distinctions such as nobles and the peasantry! Totally without wisdom but with virtue which does not disappear; totally without desire they are known as truly simple. If people are truly simple, they can follow their true nature. Then the perfect sage comes, going on about benevolence, straining for self-righteousness, and suddenly everyone begins to have doubts.

&gt;	If the Tao and Te –Way and Virtue –had not been ignored, how could benevolence and righteousness have been preferred?

&gt;	The abuse of the Tao and Te –Way and Virtue –to make benevolence and righteousness, this was the error of the sage.

&gt;	At the time of Ho Hsu, people stayed where they were, not knowing anything else; they walked but did not know where they were going; filled themselves with food and were happy slapping their bellies to show their contentment. This was what the people had. Then came the sage. He brought the cringing and grovelling of the rituals and music and infected all under Heaven with his offer of benevolence and righteousness, which he said would comfort the hearts of all. As a result the people desired and longed for knowledge, and warred against each other to gain the advantage. Nothing could stop them. All this was the fault of the sage.

Is he speaking of Confucians or Legalists? That’s the assumption I’m making as I’m reading it but I would appreciate input if anyone is interested. Thanks. "

taoism,Poems from the Cold Mountain," 

Han Shan

was a reclusive living in the mountains in the 9th century and wrote his poems on rocks. About 320 poems survived and are translated (partially) by Waley and Hendricks and others.  

Han Shan has a beautiful style which is simple but very poetic and vivid. Some would call him a Chan Buddhist, others a Daoist in the tradition of Zhuangzi. I think, he is both.

 

A

I stand here and watch the people of this world: all against one and one against all, angry, arguing, plotting and scheming. Then one day, suddenly, they die. And each gets one plot of ground: four feet wide, six feet long. If you can scheme your way out of that plot, I'll set the stone that immortalizes your name.

B

 Mr. Wang's degree says Flourishing Talent. He loves to find fault with my poems. He says I don't follow the regulations, and don't use the right techniques. He says I don't use the four tones correctly, and just stick in words any which way. I laugh at what he calls poetry: a blind man's rhymes in lukewarm praise of the sun.

C

East of me, the old lady Got rich three or four years ago. Used to be poorer than me, Now she laughs that I don't have money She laughs that I've fallen behind. I laugh that she's gotten ahead. Both of us laughing, no stopping us. East, and West.

taoism,Explain and discuss changing views on whether Taoism may be separated into philosophical and religious.,"TLDR at bottom. 

I really enjoy reading about other cultures, and learning about Taoism has been an incredible journey for me. I hope not to come off too ignorant, as I’ve only been reading about Taoism for a few months. Also, let me preface by saying I’m very interested in answers that take their roots from the current and past eastern view of Taoism, but I’m open to opinions from the more western incarnation as well. 

The question I have is whether one can truly separate Taoism into philosophical or religious schools. If not, what type of deistic practices would Taoism entail? Is it truly “whichever deity brings you closer to the path”? Or is there a little more rigidity in who/what to worship and how if you were to go deep into those communities who practice in the East? 

I’ve been reading articles from the 1980s all the way through to present; it seems that the view has been changing. I’ll summarize, this isn’t necessarily my opinion, just what I gleaned from reading:

We separated Taoism into philosophical and religious to make it more understandable to western populations, as eastern religions and how they work are incredibly hard to digest for a westerner, especially because some ideas cannot even be translated between each culture (as an example, there apparently was no concept of philosophy vs religion in the east until recently, and only through western ideologies). Sort of like how you can’t describe blue to a blind man. It appears that this created a group who wanted all the “karmic” properties of Taoism, without the complex religious subtleties. (I don’t find this wrong or right, just an objective observation.) Personally I think it has something to do with deities and the supernatural being viewed much more fluidly and less absolute than in western mindsets. Your god can be my god and my ancestor, but not my god or ever human at the same time, etc. I still can’t wrap my head around eastern worship very well. 

It appears that now we have recently been moving away from this definition, and those who study and put out papers in respected publications say it is somewhat ignorant to try to separate them. Why is this?

From what I’ve read it seems you shouldn’t separate them because there was no reason to define religious practice when Taoism was rising. It was a given that it would be included in the quest for the path. It would be like writing a biography about someone’s life but first explaining the Gregorian calendar so that the reader may understand how times and dates work. It was unnecessary because it was common knowledge. So if you should not separate them, and if a western individual truly wanted to practice Taoism, what type of religious practices would be “appropriate”? Or would any and all practices be appropriate should they harmonize with the central Tao concepts?


TLDR: can we truly separate Taoism into philosophical and religious while maintaining  it’s eastern roots. Why or why not? Why has this view been changing?
If not, what type of deistic and ritualistic practices would a typical Taoist observe? Is there any type of rigidity to this?"

I had this to eat and he had that and their were appromenly that many people their bla bla bla almost in perfect detail. If i would get the question i had said ""not mush i went to eat with a freind it was good we went Home"" while i try to remeber hint I do not, not until its to late. But i can remeber what medicin 34 old focks have at that time and what medicin it is or not on mornings or evenings I give so many different kinds then. 

When I talkt to my sister or hear it from mother. She can remeber stuff from when she was 2-4 years old and she can remeber memory like they happend just hours ago. The first memory i get when i think of my childhood is when my dad drunk af outside the house passed out so i dont try. But not remebering that he almost threw out a chair from the window. Ignorrance is bliss i guess. 

So pre-nap me wrote this ill end it with a question. Photogenic memory on people and time. Or an large mind with fragments of very spefik stuff that triggers on nostagia?

taoism,Can anyone tell me what this says?,
taoism,How do you all feel about sexuality?,"I've been getting into Taoism recently as the advice and practices, and just general outlook on life I get from it, have all really helped me to deal with my chronic depression. 

Truth be told, though, I'm a bit of a hyper sexual, and often find myself getting so into it and even obsessed that it becomes easy to lose track of myself. Sometimes it's all good, and sometimes I end up changing all my plans in order to be able to just stay in a lust haze for hours or even days. 

I was wondering how you all would view this situation, and how you all would go about finding a balance between unhealthy hypersexuality and sexual positivity. Or maybe I should just accept and make peace with that sexual part of me? Let me know what you think, thanks for your time :)"
taoism,A branch of taoism?,Is there a branch or type of taoism that could be described as between western and eastern but closer to western?
taoism,Sense of superiority,"I tend to feel a sense of superiority towards others due to my knowledge of taoism and the truths and practices it holds. I know this is counterproductive to my goal of being at peace which entails a lack of judgment and yet it continues to return. It is actually not hurting me or anyone else as I never verbalize this, I just see it as a future obstacle. I try to use logic( what I used to come to many Taoist ideas ) to bring myself to the same level as all people who may not be as aware of many things.  I have tried to think along the lines of the fact that I merely had the chance to go along the path solely due to my circumstances, and others simply had different circumstance. Meditating also helps. Does anyone have any other tips? Sorry if it’s a bit long thanks for reading:)"
taoism,The True Man,"&gt;What is meant by a ""true man""?  
&gt;  
&gt;The true men of old were not afraid when they stood alone in their views. No great exploits. No plans. If they failed, no sorrow. No self-congratulation in success ... Thus their knowledge reached all the way to Tao.  
&gt;  
&gt;The true men of old slept without dreams, woke without worries. Their food was plain. They breathed deep. True men breathe from their heels. Others breathe with their gullets, half-strangled. In dispute they heave up arguments like vomit. Where the fountains of passion lie deep the heavenly springs are soon dry.  
&gt;  
&gt;The true men of old knew no lust for life, no dread of death. Their entrance was without gladness, Their exit, yonder, eithout resistance. Easy come, easy go. They did not forget where from, nor ask where to, nor drive grimly forward fighting their way through life. They took life as it came, gladly; took death as it came, without care; and went away, yonder, Yonder!  
&gt;  
&gt;They had no mind to fight Tao. They did not try, by their own contriving, to help Tao along. These are the ones we call true men. Minds free, thoughts gone brows clear, faces serene. Were they cool? Only cool as autumn. Were they hot? No hotter than spring. All that came out of them came quiet, like the four seasons.

taoism,Taoist Advice," :D

1. At times the process of learning Taoism is also a process of healing. Take time to heal  and don’t rush. Taoism teaches patience.
2. There are over 7 billion people in the world. So there has to be over 7 billion pathways to Taoism.
3. Sometimes you need quietness.
4. People expect and think that the goal of life is perfection, it’s not. The little bits of imperfection we each have are elements of chaos that give each person individuality and distinction. Taoism teaches us how to accept both the best and worse parts of our life.
5. Taoism teaches a person to drop expectations. The more expectations you have for your life, the less you will become. A Taoist lives life without expectations. People also need a few expectations as it’s part of navigating their story. "
taoism,"The electrified meat that calls itself ""I"".","tl;dr being made of meat still weirds me out.

Edit: I think I was going a different direction when I started typing this, maybe I should post in r/existentialism instead? They aren't very conversational though.


My body, including the brain which ponders all this, is part of the same matter-energy that composes all things.

The structures and configurations of that matter-energy are massively low entropy, representing the specific, complex, individual chaotic pattern that is me.

I can abstract about my own nature far enough to be disquieted by the understanding that the abstraction and its attached feeling are both the electrified meat that calls itself ""I"".

This isn't a new revelation to me, not at all, but an amorphous anxiety still clings to it. If I could just be part of the ebb and flow of the cosmos, that would be grand, but I think I am too limited by my perceptual bubble and ego for that right now. How do I get there?

My days are like breaths, all similar to each other, but each carrying it's own name and story. Unique, but the same too. I know there is wind in the trees and there is sun soaked dust in space, but I don't really know them. I drive to and from work and the grocery store, I cook food, I sleep, I care for my people. Over and over and over. If I knew how to know the wind and the stardust like I know my phonewalletkeys, maybe it would be different?

The other alternative I see, unfortunately, is to give myself a soul, or rather the permission to delude myself that I already do. I don't think that would work though, there isn't really a place to put a soul in this electrified meat, I think. 

I am not even sure why I am bothered by existing as I do. At least part of it is the general limitations inherent to the substrate and its form; the human body can only be itself, it can only act and think in ways arising from its essential structure. Now, if I were a whale, or a stone, or a tree, or a cloud, it would be the same. The experience, if any, would be that which arose from the particular arrangement of matter-energy composing that thing. So, being something else wouldn't relieve me, I think. Maybe if I could have those experiences of different forms of existence, but maintain a continuity of self which could understand and draw comparative understanding and meaning from the experiences... maybe that would be good. Maybe.

For all that it can and cannot do, my body is one thing, and I am that, falling through time. Self aware meat.





***This post kind of got away from me, and I know it's on the edge of raving, but it felt good to write out, so I am going to put it up anyway. I don't know what kind of conversation it might stir up, but I hope for some. Thanks."
taoism,You forget your feet when the shoes are comfortable - you forget your waist when the belt is comfortable,"Zhuangzi 達生 - The Full Understanding of Life 13

&amp;#x200B;

*A) Free Translation by Thomas Merton*

&amp;#x200B;

When the Shoe Fits

&amp;#x200B;

Chu’i the draftsman

could draw more perfect circles free hand than with a compass.

His fingers brought forth spontaneous forms from nowhere.

His mind was meanwhile free and without concern with what he was doing.

No application was needed. His mind was perfectly simple and knew no obstacle.

&amp;#x200B;

So, when the shoe fits the foot is forgotten,

when the belt fits the belly is forgotten,

when the heart is right “For” and “Against” are forgotten.

&amp;#x200B;

No drives no compulsions,

No needs, no attractions:

Then your affairs are under control.

You are a free man.

&amp;#x200B;

Easy is right.

Begin right and you are easy.

Continue easy and you are right.

The right way to go easy is to forget the right way, and forget that the going is easy.

&amp;#x200B;

*B) Sinologist translation by Watson*

&amp;#x200B;

Artisan Ch'ui could draw as true as a compass or a T square

because his fingers changed along with things

and he didn't let his mind get in the way.

Therefore his Spirit Tower (ling tai) remained unified and unobstructed.

&amp;#x200B;

You forget your feet when the shoes are comfortable.

You forget your waist when the belt is comfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

Understanding forgets right and wrong when the mind is comfortable.

There is no change in what is inside, no following what is outside,

when the adjustment to events is comfortable.

You begin with what is comfortable and never experience what is uncomfortable

when you know the comfort of forgetting what is comfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

*C) Classic translation by Legge*

&amp;#x200B;

The artisan Chui made things round (and square)

more exactly than if he had used the circle and square.

The operation of his fingers on (the forms of) things

was like the transformations of them (in nature),

and required no application of his mind;

and so his Intelligence was entire and encountered no resistance.

&amp;#x200B;

To be unthought of by the foot that wears it is the fitness of a shoe;

to be unthought of by the waist is the fitness of a girdle.

&amp;#x200B;

When one's wisdom does not think of the right or the wrong (of a question under discussion),

that shows the suitability of the mind (for the question);

when one is conscious of no inward change, or outward attraction,

that shows the mastery of affairs.

He who perceives at once the fitness, and never loses the sense of it,

has the fitness that forgets all about what is fitting.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for 2 quotes plus some historical data of their respective authors.

He doesn't speak, unless it's with a highly accomplished master with the sole purpose of advancing his cultivation of the Tao. I would like to have the exact quote, the name of the emperor, his dynasty and from/until what year he lived.

taoism,How mindful should a Taoist be?,"For many years I've drawn more strength from Taoist ideas than Buddhist ones. Specifically the I Ching and Tao Te Ching are very important texts to me. At the same time I've had an on/off relationship with mindfulness which I believe is a practice routed in the Buddhist/Hindu tradition, and which is currently taking the western world by storm. 

Sometimes I feel like there is a tension between the two. Where mindfulness asks us to raise ourselves on a balcony almost 'looking down on' the flow of ourselves, Taoism seems to me to encourage us to inhabit and enjoy that flow. In its western incarnations there's a kind of 'puritanism' to the implied endpoint of mindfulness that I find a bit repellent. 

What do people think? Is this a genuine tension? How mindful should a Taoist be?   "

taoism,Diagnosed with schizophrenia and using music as a form of therapy/treatment?,"Hello everyone,

I’ve been diagnosed with schizophrenia and my day to day life is extremely difficult though I am a high-functioning schizophrenic. I studied engineering at University and made music on the side, however music is the only thing I can really do or remotely care about anymore. I’m living on disability and with the help from my family so I have a small income and also I’m interested in becoming a USPS driver because I think mail is interesting, how it connects the world, plus you rarely deal with people directly besides your superiors. 

The music aspect though (which is my favorite) conflicts with a passage I recall reading from the Dao De Ching... Which was something along the lines of passing and not getting distracted by the attractive music or tasty foods. I’ve read many translations of the book so I can’t quite pinpoint it as I don’t have that translation anymore. 

Am I interpreting that correctly? Is it to be avoided due to its illusory nature or emptiness and not an aspect of the Dao? I’ve come to understand the physical and spiritual cannot be separated and music to me is as close a direct link to the hidden aspect of existence as I’ve come across so I’m not sure if creating music as a form of cathartic release and therapy is helping my mental state or deteriorating it through distraction?

I’d love some clarification or just to hear what you think. 

First time reading the Dao De Ching was about 5 years ago, I only started practicing QiGong a little less than a year ago. Also reading a very interesting Kindle book that was $1.99 about the connection between QiGong and perspectives from the Dao De Ching as a practitioner. 

Regards and thanks for reading. "

taoism,"Very high and feel for the first time like i have taken a step closer to understanding the tao, and taoism as a whole.","I'm 17 and beggining to become interested in taoism after reading the tao of pooh. I am very interested in it but i feel like i didn't have a good understanding of the tao and what taoism really is. Until tonight, in which i got very high, and am very high.

I started browsing through my camera roll for some reason, and clicked on a video of me trying a new skate trick in my local clubs lawn bowling club, taken on my front camera propped up on a curb. I didnt get to see it earlier cause the sun was too bright. It was beautiful, the shot was so symmetrical and looked like something movie. The only sounds were ciccadas and lots of birds singing, and i just skated in complete tranquility, with no thought or worry about the study i had to be doing. 

Just purely living in that moment and being super focused on my skating and enjoying this temporary great weather. Usually i dont enjoy skating during study season because the studying is in the front and back of my mind, and it puts strain on my enjoyment and restricts me from fully being in that moment, but this time my time my mind was empty of the past and future and fully open to be filled with that present moment. 

This is what clicked the switch in my head that made me feel more connected to taoism, and I'm really excited to explore it now. I know this is not entirely what taoism is about, but its still something. 

This thinking about this also made me hyper aware of how damn free i am as a teen, as i feel like this mindset is much harder to achieve as an adult, and how it balances perfectly with the study, i have really unenjoyable portions of my day but it comes with an upside cause the breaks are phenomenal, and they balance perfectly with the boring study sessions. And i can look at this balance with a positive light.

Thanks if you read the whole thing. I feel like this is going to sound meniacal when i read it tommorow morning."

taoism,Something aspiring Dao cultivators need to know.,"Daoism and Buddhism are often a refuge for people who don't fit in with mainstream society.
This may occur for many reasons, but it is important to be aware of this and if it accurately describes you as a person to not allow Daoism to become an excuse for giving in to the worst aspects of your inner nature.
Real Daoism like that espoused in the Dao De Jing should make your personal flaws more obvious to you.
You should look at your inner environment and realize how much of it is governed by desire and negative emotions.
Daoism at its root is a philosophy dedicated to overcoming these inner personal flaws in order to ascend beyond the suffering of the mundane life of people caught up in the affairs of the world.
It is very important not to use Daoist teachings as an excuse to be antisocial and weird.  If you really want to walk the walk of the Daoist lifestyle it means you have to try very hard to live the precepts written in the classics.
This is a very difficult thing and you don't master it after a few days, a few months or even a few years.  I know a couple of people who have really taken it a long way and they are still very flawed and normal human beings.
Whether you picks Daoism, Buddhism, Christianity, stoicism or any of the other ideological options out there, the keys are always in your hands and only you can unlock the various doors which currently hinder your progress.
Also don't be the person who gives up half way.  You may never make it to the top of the mountain, but you should keep climbing because it can only get better as you progress in your abilities."

taoism,The Simplicity of Taoist Meditation,"Taoist meditation is very simple. 

First thing to do is either find a silent place to sit with no distraction or sit within a place surrounded by nature without human interaction or industry getting in the way.

Second thing is sit comfortably either crisscross or on a comfy chair or couch.

Third thing is breath deep and slowly when inhaling and exhaling for a few moments to relax your body. (make sure this is continuous as well)

Forth is to begin to close your eyes and enter the phase.

The fifth thing is to imagine a place within nature that creates the feeling of harmony. For instance, maybe you are sitting on a cloud above a beautiful rain forest or on a peak of a mountain looking down upon a huge myriad of trees. 

Lastly, I would like you to repeat these things within your mind within breathing. When you Inhale: Repeat the words ""Heart-Even,"" and for Exhale: ""Energy-Harmonious.""

This is the way I meditate. Hope this helps and Much love."

taoism,Why Taoism Can Change The World," A foreign believer with the Taoist name ""Jingxiang"" said that Taoism clarified his confusions and became his spiritual home. 

&amp;#x200B;

People that become simple and sincere can help other people to secure a peaceful mind, and following the laws of nature will ensure sustainable development, respecting public lives will generate common prosperity and striving to promote harmony between heaven and mankind as well as world peace.

&amp;#x200B;

Westerners can easily accept Taoist concepts, such as the harmony among all things and the integration of Yin and Yang. Many of them are also interested in the Taoist theories of preserving one's health, so Taoism is becoming increasingly attractive and popular. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Experts said that Taoism, which originated and developed in China, has a long history and rich doctrines. Currently, the whole world faces a series of issues, such as energy crises and the deterioration of global ecological environment, which have drawn many people's attention to the Taoist principles of following the law of nature and being kind to all living things.  

&amp;#x200B;

 Respecting Taoism, cherishing virtues and co-existing harmoniously are the themes of the Taoist forum. The Taoists from China and foreign countries all had a deeper understanding about subjects such as ""following nature,"" ""valuing and enjoying the life,"" ""being kind to all lives"" and ""returning to the original simplicity."" Meanwhile, they also widely discussed the issue of further promoting Taoist culture in the world.  "

Recall the fighter pilots that were captured and burned alive. Now you might say my mind is just creating scenarios that would never happen, but it happened to them, and if I didn't leave it could've happened to me. Perhaps in a past life it has.

Now, how is that even endurable? How is it possible to even withstand such a death and what does a brutal death such as that have to do with 'the Way'? Skin melting, then crisping, inhaling superheated air, perhaps choking to death on fumes before the fire roasts your internal organs and they stop functioning, your eyeballs being steamed. I don't understand. Is that the destruction of the ego?

I have really nothing else to comment after typing that up, other than I don't understand and I'm not even sure what it is I don't understand anymore.

taoism,Taoist Appreciation,"   One thing that really makes all Taoist teachings much easier to follow is living in the moment. Taoists manage to live worry free, because worry comes from having one’s mind in the future. Taoists avoid regret because regret comes from living in the past. On top of that, but it is much easier to forgive others if you live in the moment. It is much easier to avoid stress, to love yourself, to enjoy the people around you, to appreciate your environment when you live in the moment. 

   My hardest part of following this is not thinking about the future, I am a huge worrier. But does worrying about graduating college really make me do better in my classes now? No, it makes me have panic attacks that keep me from doing my essays when I’m supposed to. If I just focus on the single assignment I have to do right now, it’s a lot less daunting than thinking about the dozens of assignment I have to do all year. And once the stress is gone, my assignments are much better. 

When you dwell on the past or future, you don’t get to enjoy the present, which of course will become your regretful past and then the cycle continues. Everything in your past happened. That’s all there is to it, you can’t change it. It may have changed you but if you live in the past than you are letting it continue to change you. You get stuck there. And if you are holding a grudge over something that happened in your past, you are only making yourself upset. That’s how living in the moment helps you to forgive. When you are angry at someone you aren’t taking away their peace, you’re taking away your own. I find it much more easy to forgive now because when someone apologizes to me, I can already see that they are a different person then they used to be and that is what should count. Maybe it’s hard to forgive who they were, but it is easy to give peace to the person they became, even if I don’t fully mean it. Continuing a fight would only continue the pain and hurt feelings. "

taoism,The In-Between Moments,"The In-Between Moments

Find the in-between moments. The moments in time where nothing is happening. Right after the last thing that happened stops happening, and right before the next thing starts to happen. Make these moments in time your own. Be aware that you are the only one there, and the only one watching. Your entire reality, every single moment of your existence, is experienced only by you. Nobody but you can see what you are looking at. What does it look like to you? What do you want it to look like? Notice and become part of these moments of silence, listen to the calm and observe yourself watching as nothing at all happens. Sink yourself deep into this moment and experience the temporary nothingness you’ve become a part of. Observe your perception of the reality that you exist in, the reality that you are creating. You are alone. You are a single mind observing it’s own simulation. In the silence of these negative spaces in reality, when nothing is happening as time stands still, create the reality that you want. In these moments where nothing exists, and there are no more events being processed, your mind will make use of this unused processing power to observe reality through your minds eye. Observing without judgment or opinion, a sustained flow of pure awareness. With this pure awareness, the existence of everything can be seen with a single glance of the mind. Observing all that you know from the perspective of your truest and wisest self. Stay here in this void that you’ve created, cease to exist until something happens once again. When events start to happen, and time continues on, with this perception you’ll enter a new reality, the one that you create yourself.

taoism,Need your opinion: Living life by one principle,"I often feel the need to live my life based on principles or truths.

I affirm these to myself throughout the day when I need a reminder or feel lost. Here are some examples.

My purpose is to help others. I always do the best job I can do. Food is just my fuel.

I recently discovered the taoism teachings and loved how it says to just go with the flow and let go.

In your opinion, are there any principles that I can affirm throughout my whole life despite being a changing self??

In other words, does the tao present any concept we can have faith in besides ""letting go""?

I feel that the real world I live in, being a college student, you need to stand for something.

For example, I cannot write all of my essays for applications on meditation and letting go of thoughts.

taoism,Taoism Physics paradox.,"So Im not gona try to explain my thought in spefic details but i feel theirs a simularity between them. While both quantuum Physics and Taoism is probably the 2 hardest subjekts to explain in this world because we spend so mush energi learning its wrong wish its not.

&amp;#x200B;

You could apply some part of science into the way of zen. I stumble on this thought some time. So confusism tells how we should interact in society in the same way that relative physics can explain how the world works on large scales. 

&amp;#x200B;

From my limited view of Taoism is being one with nature and accepting it and being your own induvidial at the same time. Well its a part of it. Theirs a plan and not I just have to trust in it. One english word thats close to Taoism is unsure. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I took my drivers licence couple of week ago. It was a 1 week in a other city. So we a group of 6 people from diffrent backgrounds. We were all strangers but the goal was their DRIVERS LICENCE! I trusted that I had the knowledge but i belived that it was good for me to be their somehow. I cant explain but i feel that you have to apply that feeling to all life then you would be on the way of being ""blessed"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Lets jump and to quatuum physics a bit and the way how a partical acts in a Quantuum field. We dont know anything about the particle until we look at that particle. Theirs a cat in a box is it dead or not? We dont know until we opened the box and look. We just have to accept the cat in the box is dead and not dead in the box. Simple way of explaining it. This acceptance you have to apply to life.  ""Its just the way it is"".  

&amp;#x200B;

So as kids we learn relative physics that objektives exist. And we learn the interaction between our father and mother. Their gona still be our father and mother tomorrow. Confuism. But what are we loseing when we learn this way of thinking? The inherit way of the nature. 

&amp;#x200B;

So if you play a simple game of Pikabo with a baby. When the baby ses your face you exist but when you hide your face to the baby you stopped existing. Same way a baby doesen´t know where food comes from but it eats it. Babies are our biggest gurus and quantuum scientists. 

&amp;#x200B;

taoism,Immortal intervention?,"Hello everyone,

I'm new to the group and have only very recently begun a more serious study of Taoism in its many facets.  

I wanted to ask, within any of the schools, if there was a belief that the Immortals or other accomplished beings assist or inspire individuals to persue a path of spiritual cultivation?  Do they notice those with sincere desire and help facilitate circumstances that would bring about an opportunity for practice?

Thanks in advance for your help!"

taoism,Variations of Meditation,"When people think of meditation, they generally think of sitting down and breathing whilst focusing on the breath to attain a greater focus on the present moment. But recently I've been considering the idea of other forms of meditation. 

Art for example; the premise behind meditating is to ultimately grow closer to this idea of 'wu wei' (effortless action) and to live in the present; in regards to art - if one focus' on the drawing and the drawing alone without any sort of interference - is this not the same as focusing on the breath?
Both activities involve allowing thoughts to pass and to simply focus on what you are doing (this principle can be applied to music, cooking, working etc.)

The reason as to why I ask this is because, I'm currently at my last year of high school and find that if I can attain an almost 'permanent state of meditation' whilst doing anything (including work) then perhaps my stress levels will start to decrease.

Thank you."

taoism,Why this subreddit?,"Reddit recommended r/taoism to me and it seems like you get content brigaded by “Zen Buddhists” just like r/zen! I don’t know what you base your discussion on if you have no texts, unless you’re using modern texts with no historical basis or I’m missing something.

It reads like everyone here’s making stuff up about how to behave more “in tune” with the Tao or the Way, with some countering that that’s missing the point. Ultimately all you can do is try to write OC... but then why call it Taoism?

Edit: After looking at the sidebar...

I knew about a very small number of texts that are credible sources on Taoism. It’s nice to see discussion on them, though the OPs on one were all deleted.

I’m skeptical about the vast majority of other texts that aren’t just modern studies of original texts.

What’s curious is that I can barely find a single recent post or comment quoting a believable source. Without that as a basis for discussion I’m skeptical of what you have to say."
taoism,How to be in alignment with the Dao,"There is one coping mechanism which can be used for any and every situation. There is no more need for rationalizing and thinking of other ways to make things seem alright and good.

If we not only accept the way everything is (the Dao), but we will/wish for it to be the way it is, we will never be averse to anything, we will want everything to happen exactly as it does. 

This is what it means to be in alignment with the Dao. 

Ex: you drop a coffee cup and it breaks. Coffee is all over the floor. Before you think anything about it, you recall ""I wanted this to happen, because I am the Dao and i wish for everything to happen as it does""."

taoism,On Planning and Goals as a Taoist,"Often times when I talk to people about Taoism, they are confused by the idea of non-action, acting without acting, doing without doing. When I speak of non-action, some confuse this with apathy, or a lack of caring or doing anything at all.

Some of you out there who are new to Taoism might also be confused by this idea. You might say, “Well what about my goals? What about my plans for the future? How am I supposed to accomplish what I want in life if I do not act or do not do?”

Taoism and the way of non-action does not mean you cannot have goals, or an idea for how you would like your life to turn out. It is about letting yourself move naturally in that direction without effort. Know you are on the right course without knowing the course.

 I like to think of it like this: have goals, have things that you would like to do with your life, but don’t force it. Don’t try to control every aspect of how you get there. Don’t get so caught up in the “how” that you miss out on the “now”. Let things work themselves out, while knowing where you want to go. When you let go of control, and let things do what they will do, it is amazing how often you find yourself ending up where you wanted to be, without effort. 

If I could illustrate this with a little allegory:

When sailing, the sailor is at the mercy of the wind. The wind blows where it will, ever changing in its direction and intensity. The sailor can not control the direction the wind blows, nor can the sailor fix their sail firmly in one direction and expect to arrive at their destination. To try to do so would be absurd. Instead, the sailor must change the orientation of their sail from time to time, adjusting for the changing winds and using them to their advantage. 

In life, be like the sailor. Have a destination in mind, and as the winds change, adjust your sail to move there. Once you have adjusted, step back and enjoy the beauty of the seas. Do not focus so intently on the winds that you tediously tend to every wayward breeze; if you do, you will lose sight of your destination and get lost at sea. Simply adjust, step back, and relax. That is the way of the Tao."

taoism,A question regarding 'merge consciousness',"so i'm reading a book titled 'the tao of abundance' and there's a chapter that talks about concentration and merge consciousness - a state of being so **completely absorbed** in an object, experience, or event that all sense of time, space and self are lost. while logically it makes sense to me, that concentration removes the ego and helps us to become one with nature, later on there's a chapter that talks about mindfulness and mindful meditation - focusing your mind as though you were looking through a telescope **from a distance**. 

&amp;#x200B;

aren't the 2 ideas contradicting each other? i do realise that both ideas promote letting go of the ego, but if i am completely absorbed in doing a certain thing then how am i able to be mindful of that action by observing myself doing it?

taoism,Shhh,
taoism,Just something I wanted to share,"Since my journey towards Tao began, the most difficult (and yet - most rewarding!) obstacle I encountered has to be related with being 'stupid'. Being open to see the world with the stance of ""I don't know what is going to happen and what is  the meaning of it"". Being open to people without evaluating their actions and intentions which I have no real way of knowing. And, of course, being forgiving and supporting to myself for doing the opposite of what I just described, as I would forgive a newborn child for spilling juice.

To be truly open and 'stupid' basically requires letting go of the piles of information (and personal opinions about that information) which I built up for many many years. It seemed to me like THE answer comes when a certain amount of answers is achieved. And therefore, even though I am able to notice how this belief may not be truly valid, I still am struggling every day to re-discover how the 'truth' is not in these precious and shiny piles of ""knowledge"", but in this very moment.

It's almost like saving a million dollars to buy a Ferrari, and then gifting it to some person without having a test drive in it. At first, the act of doing so provides with a portion of doubt and resistance, and then it brings a sense of deep satisfaction, humility and understanding of how material possessions isn't worth much without sharing them.

But then again, every morning this dude drives to your place and asks ""Are you sure you don't want this car? It's really great, trust me!""."

Wouldn’t that also mean that if there’s a time to submit, there’s a time to act, and fight for what you want to achieve? (Meaning work harder, strive for more, attack the day, etc.)

I hear both from society. I hear both in myself. I hear or see both in others at different times.

It's a fascinating balance, constantly shifting and moving. When one seems like the best and only way to be, the other reappears and the first seems ignorant, shortsighted, and illusory (at least in my experience).

taoism,"Taoist meditators please help me, what is going on","I meditated with quite wrong attitudes for 2 years I later learned I did all the meditations wrong almost the opposite attitude, to the extend of rejection. I once did a Hindu, designed for spiritual experiences, experiencing oneness, cosmic consciousness etc., mantra with a third eye focus (which sold me as a stress relief I had no idea), also I practiced some Eckhart Tolle's Present Moment stuff, and Secular and Buddhist breath focus. So after doing that Hindu Mantra for 5-6 months, I started to feel really stuffed head and kinda depersonalized, but the thing is, it was not complete depersonalization or dissociation, it just there was a fog and energy stuckness feeling around the head and that was the creator of my symptoms, my start to go down hill at the start of summer(4-5 months ago precisely), I also posted here before. Long story short, I have tried so many things, I used many techniques to no avail, I don't know what it is or what to do, but here is the deal, I have this energy thing in my head and body(it's %90 not kundalini I did my research quite long, and posted on /r/kundalini many many times and talked with ppl there, I don't experience jolting or other weird symptoms of kundalini), sometimes it gets weird and excited out and I stuck with that kinda feeling and it just makes me unable to experience life, like I can go focus on present and get out of it, but then I'm unable to have feelings and turn to my body back, like when I do Loving Kindness(Metta) Meditation, even simple love Meditation like that, makes those energy all move again, it's like Meditation increase this energy and goes sometimes to head, or sometimes  I experience that weird ""pull"" like energy or whatever tries to come down from head, but my body starts to contraction and spams(when seen from outside it's no appearant, it's like it's trying to stretch itself). I some times get this energy ""pull"" from upper body to lower body. It's a pull that is so strong I feel like my life itself is trying to pour itself down and out. It hurts my ass of when it happens, the thing is, if I just recognize it and don't give a fuck, it just appears as normal sensation, but after letting it, ""accepting"" it , it starts to go pull down, from upper body to lower body, then the painful and hurting experience happens but then I experience this comfort, like I'm back to life and I feel like I woke up from a foggy dream, I think to myself wtf happened to me, like I don't remember anything quite well and just woken up from a dream, like came back to reality , I'm describing what I experience exactly here now: It's like my lower body is closed up, and specially my calves feels blockaged, tense and stuffed, so when I meditated on the third eye and stuff, the energy tried to work on there, but since I experienced many traumas, depressions, and hospitalized once and used +30 medical drugs, I suspect that my energy body was damaged, so my legs(my grounded lower part) was closed, so when I went into these kind of practices, the energy issues appeared to be problem when the circulation couldn't be managed. My interpretation a little bit exeggarated about the events, I mean the spasms etc, not that intense like kriyas even, but the fog, dp dr, numbness, no emotions, not being able to think is quite real, I don't know what is happening to me, I'm open to any discussions, Did I fuck up with my energy body if there is such a thing? Which that is my first suspicion even I'm ignorant about these subjects, but that is what I see from observing this debiliating issues over past 4-5 months, worst thing is I'm unable to plan ahead and think sometimes because the fog of energy makes me unable to do. I had many goals and I'm a hardworker but it's taking my essence of life  , Do I need to do an intense grouding and opening up the calves or legs with stretch or intense fitness, do energy gets blocked when there is physical tenseness? That is my last and best bet I don't know it it would help "

taoism,More about Internal Alchemy,"There was some discussion about Internal Alchemy recently. I've been working on a book review on the subject for about a month and just published my article on it. If you are interested in the subject, the book ***Internal Alchemy for Everyone***, by [Chungtao Ho](http://threepinespress.com/) is a worthwhile read because it gives you an overview of what I'd call a ""fundamentalist Daoist"" understanding of the subject. I don't live in that universe, however, so mostly my article takes it to task. Either way, any rational comments are always appreciated.

My ideas are

* Tao Te Ching/Inner Chapters readings and discussion

* Individuals sharing how they ""used"" the Tao or how it impacted them recently

* Group meditation

I ask because there are often discussions here about finding a local Taoist group and I tend to think that we should be the change we want to see in the world. So now I'm thinking about trying to get something going in my area (Atlanta for anyone else interested) but I want to build a solid plan first."

I have been wondering recently about Taoist communities. I see so many Christian churches and I really wish I could find something similar with Taoism. Has anyone here found a good community near them to practice with? How should I go about finding one? Or is the nature of Taoism just solitary?

taoism,How to practice Taoism,"Hello guys, I’m new Taoism, and I feel like I’m confusing myself over how I should or need to live... I love Daoist philosophy, and I’ve found a lot of peace and joy in it, and in meditation as well. But as I’ve learned more about Taoism, I’ve found myself getting increasingly anxious about not correctly practicing Taoism. I’m scared that I’ll be missing out on some great enlightenment and that my life will be wasted if I don’t practice right. But I don’t have a teacher, and I read somewhere that the Tao Te Ching is just like 1% of Taoism. So i feel really lost.

I guess I just wanted to know if I should be aiming for enlightenment, or if I need to just enjoy life as it is, and not strive for that. I’m just confused and getting frustrated. Any help with how I should practice or learn how it practice would be wonderful. Thank you so much for reading my post!"
taoism,Taoism and Feng Shui,"   What is Taoism, and what does it have to do with good Feng Shui? Let's look into the connection between these two philosophical schools of thought. Taoism and Feng Shui share the same roots, as both disciplines evolved from the ancient wisdom of understanding the interconnections of everything around us; the one Universal energy (chi) as expressed in many forms.

&amp;#x200B;

All Feng Shui schools, especially the classical Feng Shui schools, are based on the study of creating a harmonious quality of energy; and the Yin Yang principle, along with the five elements principle, is at the foundation of good Feng Shui.

  
   While Taoism is a philosophical body of knowledge as applied to one's way of being, Feng Shui evolved into a slightly different direction. It became the study of creating environments that are aligned with the natural flow of the Universe, environments that can nurture and sustain one's energy and quality of life.

  
   The Taoism roots are very strong in Feng Shui, especially in schools that calculate the time factor. However, sometimes this Feng Shui info is taken to the extreme, and its application can become the opposite of the Taoist wisdom. "
taoism,another take on the three treasures,"Recently there was a good post about the three treasures of essence, energy and spirit, so I would like to add to this by discussing the big three treasures of Daoism.
The three treasures have three categories each with three individual treasures.  This makes up nine treasures altogether because nine is a lucky number in Daoism.
The first set of three treasures is for people who study the Dao and holds that the three upper deities of Daoism hold the three treasures of the Dao, the scriptures and the teacher which are proliferated in Daoist teachings on earth.
The second set of treasures is for people who cultivate the Dao and are our life essence, energy and spirit which are cultivated when we practice meditation.
The third set of treasures is for those who practice the Dao in the world. They are kindness, frugality and caution before the heavens as are detailed in the Dao De Jing.

It is important for Daoists and students of Daoism to cultivate all nine treasures.  The study of the Dao is transmitted by our teachers and the scriptures.  When we learn the teachings we can practice meditation and the three inner treasures.  We also should proliferate the virtue of Daoism in the world and we will master the last three treasures."
taoism,The Three Treasures,"In the Taoist tradition the life is supported by three main pillars, these three pillars or compounds are important to lead a balanced and healthy life. The translation of these is very vague and every Taoist master might give you a slightly different response. This translation here is the classic version of Qi, Jing and Shen. Basically they can be translated as: Qi is **energy building**. Jing is **energy saving** and Shen has a lot to do with our nervous system and **awareness**.

Taoist masters use the knowledge of the three treasures to indicate their own life and help others by indicating their life problems. The three treasures are the basic principle for diagnostics in traditional chinese medicine. The real interpretation of the three treasures can be understood by collecting experience through self-awareness. This does include Qi Gong, Tai Chi and Kung Fu training.

**Qi (Vitality)**

*Qi*, the first Treasure, is the energy that creates our vitality. Through the constant interaction of Yin and Yang change is brought into being. *Qi* is the activity of Yin and Yang. Movement, functioning and thought is the result of *Qi*. The nature of *Qi* is to move. In the Three Treasures system includes both Energy and Blood. It nourishes and protects us. *Qi* is said to be produced as a result of the functions of the Lungs and Spleen. Therefore, *Qi* tonics strengthen the digestive, assimilative and respiratory functions.

When *Qi* condenses, it becomes *Jing*. Fast moving *Qi* is considered to be Yang while slow moving *Qi* is Yin. In the system of the Three Treasures, blood is considered to be a part of the *Qi* component of our being. Blood is said to be produced from the food ingested after the *Qi* has been extracted through the action of the Spleen. The red blood cells are said to be nutritive and are thus associated with the Ying Qi (Yin), while the white blood cells are protective and are associated with Wei Qi (Yang). *Qi* tonics are generally believed to have potent immune modulating activity. *Qi* tonics, composed of Energy and/or Blood tonics, increase our ability to function fully and adaptively as human beings.

**Jing (Essence)**

*Jing* is the second Treasure and is translated as ""Regenerative Essence,"" or simply as ""Essence."" *Jing* is the refined energy of the body. It provides the foundation for all activity and is said to be the ""root"" of our vitality. *Jing* is the primal energy of life. It is closely associated with our genetic potential, and is associated with the aging process. *Jing* is stored energy and provides the reserves required to adapt to all the various stresses encountered in life. Since *Jing* is concentrated energy, it manifests materially. *Jing* also is said to control a number of primary human functions: the reproductive organs and their various substances and functions; the power and clarity of the mind; and the integrity of one's physical structure. *Jing*, which is a blend of Yin and Yang energy, is said to be stored in the ""Kidney."" *Jing* is generally associated these days with the hormones of the reproductive and adrenal glands, and*Jing* is the vital essence concentrated in the sperm and ova.

It is considered extremely difficult to enhance the original *Jing* after conception, although it is not at all difficult to deplete and weaken it, and thus to weaken and shorten one's life. The only way to strengthen the original*Jing* is through specific highly sophisticated yogic techniques such as those developed by the Daoists and by consuming certain potent tonic herbs known as *Jing* tonics. The purpose of taking *Jing* tonic herbs is to maintain healthy levels of postnatal *Jing*. If postnatal *Jing* is maintained at sufficient levels, prenatal *Jing* is used much more slowly and the aging process is slowed down.

When *Jing* is strong, vitality and youthfulness remain. Strong *Jing* energy in the Kidneys, so the Chinese say, will lead to a long and vigorous life, while a loss of *Jing* will result in physical and mental degeneration and a shortening of one's life. *Jing* is essential to life and when it runs low our life force is severely diminished and thus we lose all power to adapt. The quantity of Essence determines both our life span and the ultimate vitality of our life.*Jing* is burned up in the body by life itself, but most especially by chronic and acute stress and excessive behavior, including overwork, excessive emotionalism, substance abuse, chronic pain or illness, and marital excess (especially in men). Excessive menstrual patterns, pregnancy and childbirth can result in a dramatic drain on the *Jing* of a woman, especially in middle aged women. When *Jing* is depleted below a level required to survive, we die. Eventually everyone runs out of *Jing* and thus everyone dies (at least physically).

**Shen (Spirit)**

*Shen* is the third Treasure. *Shen* is the Holy Spirit which directs *Qi*. It may also be translated as our ""higher consciousness."" This is ultimately the most important of the Three Treasures because it reflects our higher nature as human beings. Chinese masters say that *Shen* is the all-embracing love that resides in our ""Heart,"" a primary organ system. *Shen* is the spiritual radiance of a human being and is the ultimate and most refined level of energetics in the universe. *Shen* is not considered to be an emotion, or even a state of mind. It presides over the emotions and manifests as all-encompassing compassion, and non-discriminating, non-judgemental awareness. *Shen* is expressed as love, compassion, kindness, generosity, acceptance, forgiveness and tolerance. It manifests as our wisdom and our ability to see all sides of all issues, our ability to rise above the world of right and wrong, good and bad, yours and mine, high and low, and so on. *Shen* is our higher knowledge that everything is one, even though nature manifests dualistically and cyclically, often obscuring our vision and creating illusion.

Our true Spirit, which the Chinese call *Shen*, is the spark of divinity that resides within the heart of every human being and manifests as love, kindness, compassion, generosity, giving, tolerance, forgiveness, mercy, tenderness and the appreciation of beauty. It is the Spirit of a human being as the divine messenger, the channel of God's will and love. *Shen* is the purpose of all spiritual paths. It is the Buddha's desire to end suffering and it is Christ's love and compassion... *Shen* manifests only when the heart is open. Once the heart is open, *Shen* manifests as light that illuminates the path of a man or woman in life's journey toward the spiritual goal and along the spiritual path.

taoism,How important is “internal alchemy”?,"I’ve recently gotten into Taoism, and love the philosophy/way of living. It’s been very helpful to me. As I’ve been learning more I’ve found out about the “internal alchemy” practices of Taoism, and the cosmology associated with it, and these things don’t resonate with me at all the same way that the mindset of Taoism does. In fact, the emphasis on achieving wellness almost seems to go against wu wei to me. It’s bummed me out a bit and I’ve been in a funk over it for a couple days, so I thought I would just ask you guys what you think. How important to practicing Taoism is believing in qi and internal alchemy?"

One thing they mostly have in common is living in the moment which is understandable. But I've seen a lot of people describing people who focus too much on the short-term/now based goals as being degenerates or slackers I guess. I feel like I personally have seen and felt this too as I've grown up on a foundation of creating goals for yourself and striving towards them through hard work and ambition. Am I missing the point about Taoism by feeling this way?

Edit: Thanks for all your amazing responses, I've read all of them and I apologize if I havent responded to a lot of them as a I've been busy.

taoism,Why we cry,"Note: truth is synonymous with the Dao in this thought.

We cry because we realize the bare truth. Without anything to misconstrew or hide it in the slightest. 

The reason we cry is because we hide the truth from ourselves; we do not think the truth is true, we do not accept the truth, we do not think about the truth (repression); but when the truth shows itself, there is no denying it. 
Crying is a display of coming to terms with the truth. But eventually, we fall out of terms and end up hiding it again. Using defense mechanisms, we stop believing in the truth and start caring about nonsense. We argue over insignificant things, and we only realize what we have done when we are given a reason to cry - the truth.

Edit: apply the death of a loved one as an example of when we cry. This is when we are most susceptible to the Dao revealing itself to us. Though the Dao is always here.

There's a girl that I like so much, I think it's the only person who I care in this planet. We've been together through a lot of things and been thinking about our future since we're kids. Although we are the type of couple who breaks up every week but never be without the other in the end.

The thing is, I live in a turbulent country, where everything is going worse every year and nobody can guarantee their future (violence and economic problems). I've been thinking about leaving this country even before I met her, specially to go to a certain country which imo it's the best country in the world. I've been fascinated by its culture and security and even know how to speak a little of its language already.

And now I got the opportunity to go to this country, but if I go, I will lose her. She doesn't want to come with me by no way, we've been discussing this for years but I can't change her mind, and now she says that If I go I will lose her forever.

She have friends and family here, but I just have her.

taoism,Anti-intellectualism in Taoism,"I’m reading the Tao of Pooh and I’m finding it pretty interesting. However the author keeps pushing this lesson about how being scholarly and clever is not the way to live because we can’t hope to know everything and therefore should be content with life as it is. I can see this being a helpful lesson in situations where you are simply overthinking things, but he keeps pushing it as if being intellectually curious and scholastic is a bad thing.

Is this really a branch of thought central to the Tao? What if the Tao encourages me to pursue my intellectual curiosities? What if engaging in the scientific method brings me fulfilment and happiness? I would have thought that a philosophy that appreciates and understands the cyclical nature of the world would support the pursuit of intellectualism as well as is it supports the pursuit of wisdom."

He gets in other peoples buisness and does nothing but rant. He changes his mind allot about allot of things and is very judgemental and complains about other people nonstop but is rather cold and indifferent if you or anyone else may be going through a tough time lacking empathy and is rather impatient. Hes a bit self indulgent he does nothing but get drunk every night he doesn't read the Tao Te Ching doesn't meditate he just goes around saying he is one like a badge of honor and can lack integrity at times. I like the guy but I almost yelled at him for being hypocritical and bad mouthing people behind their back I wanna talk to him but he hardly listens I don't know what to say like ""dude...are you really a daoist?""

taoism,Lao Tzu and Confucius (Story Two),"  Once Chuang Tzu travelled in State Chu and came to a stretch of grassland where no houses were in sight. He found a skeleton hidden in the high grass, and it was worn by weather but every bone was there in the form of a human body. Chuang Tzu knocked it with his whip handle and asked, ""Did you so lust for life that you acted without reason, and so ended thus? Or did you lose your state and fall as a victim of axe and sword, and so end thus? Or did you do something wrong and were shamed to see your parents, wife, and children, and so ended thus? Or did you freeze or starve, and so end thus? Or did you live your full life span and end thus in your later years?""   


  As dark set in, Chuang Tzu took the skull as a pillow and fell into sleep. In the middle of the night, the skeleton came into his dream as a middle-aged man, and said, ""You sound like an eloquent disputer. What you said are all entanglements of human life, and the dead has not a single one of them. Do you want me to tell you about death?""   


""Do please!""  


""In death,"" he said, ""There is no lord above and no slave below. There are no such things as the four seasons, cold and hot. The eternity of heaven and earth marks the time. The joy of a king cannot surpass ours.""   


  Chuang Tzu did not believe it, and said, ""I happen to know the Official in Charge of Life and Death. If I asked him to bring you back to life, put flesh back on your bones, and return you to your parents, your wife and your children, your neighbours and your friends down home, would you want that?""   


  The skeleton man became agitated as if he feared some great punishment, and replied, ""How could I give up the joy of a king and take up again the suffering of humanity?""  "

taoism,Finding the Heart of Wudang," When we see the swallows fly over our houses, we instinctively find a little more freedom in our heart. They glide with such elegance in the air and dance with their partners high up in the sky. It is a sign, of having a sincere heart when such good things visualize before our eyes. We are the sender and receiver of what we sow.  We live for the modality of such transcendence; it is our human nature to seek the truth within.

Walking in the Wudang Mountains is similar to this modal logic; I may reach this top of the hill just to find another top which is much higher. Finally, I realize the importance of the valleys and the lowest level of virtue. Reaching high is not essentially more complicated than stepping in the lowest valley. Away from this three dimensions, all paths are the same when we ignore the distance I may enjoy the current moment without worries; I am on the way.

In nature, there is no such thing as elegance, only purity. We define elegance when we see purity. That is why we find Taiji movements elegant when they coordinate with nature. Coordination with nature can be referred as the balance between Yin and Yang. We feel the subtle definition between those extremes, the path of tranquility; this is referred as silk thread balancing along this indescribable condition of eternity. When truth crystallizes, we find straight lines in-between; walking the path of our human nature.

We all strive for the eternal condition, yet we start living at birth and die old. What we realize is that the location called Wudang might be the very definition of life experience. When you focus, you may change the outside subconsciously. The so called immortality is like a rain drop, the acceleration to earth is not defined by itself but defined by nature. When we see the moment to become eternal, we gain immortality in an instant, but at the same time, we strive for improvement and change. We are inferior to nature and living is always a tolerance between absolutes.

It is foolish to say to enjoy each breath, but breathing is the way of human life. It is comfortable to breathe, and it differs from each location and situation. At this very moment, we grab the source of power and become apparent in our consciousness. It makes us able to define the Yang power.

I am conscious that is the pure awareness of my intuition, so I am living intentional with each breath and subconsciously live in harmony with nature.

The essence of Daoism is untough of all necessities and stares at the one truth from which all things are created. Wudang will not appear to you as beautiful but as a complete view of the fundamentals. During our practice, we strive sincerely to achieve and fail. Failing is as important as achieving to learn the value of the answer.  Achieving our goal is a given opportunity from heaven to learn our low place, we were already finished with our ideas and are satisfied, yet the whole thing is far from complete.

https://i.redd.it/fbeu8jk1zhr11.jpg

Ironically, I understand the behavior of the Dao, and this is why we all follow our subconsciousness. That no matter what appearance might reveal in front of you, Wudang is a way of the heart, inscribed in the very soul. I have only gained opportunities, so there is nothing to lose, that is how rich the Dao is based on the fundamentals of nature. Practice sincerely with your whole heart, do not accept half-heartily the half truth, when we put in our effort we receive the message of our behavior, only you are the judge if that is a lost or new opportunity. Correcting the balance of our world is what is desperately needed to achieve harmony with others. The way of Wudang knows no compromise or other definition, then accepting the whole being – the whole self, and embrace the whole with all that’s good and bad. The bad is a reliever of misery pointing out what is missing, and the good is a way to move forward but would not be known without the opposite.

No matter where you are, live Wudang in your heart and practice to become aware of each moment, gain the whole truth and realize what is important to you. Define yourself and give guidance to those who need it. That is the way of the Dao and the only message that will continue to reach through generations and enrich everyone with the wisdom of nature – the principle of Wuwei.

taoism,I never realized how much energy it takes to be accommodating (yin),"I've been mostly a type A, go-getter yang type of guy. Spending lots of energy to create things, do things, and make things happen in the world.

Now I realize how much energy people spent accommodating me, especially women. 

When someone wants to make me do something, and I don't want to do it, creating the energy to do it is actually quite taxing. It seems to be a mirror image of the energy from the person doing it. 

The rewards seem to be keeping a relationship with the person doing the yang, as they are looking for yin. There may be other rewards as well, like getting paid to do do what others want you to do in the workplace. 

Being really accommodating to others' proactiveness is new to me, so I would appreciate perspectives on being yin or shifting between the two."
taoism,What is Wellness," 

### WELLNESS

Perhaps the greatest legacy of Taoism is the art of wellness, how to preserve one's health. Wellness is talked about very much today, but what does it actually mean? What are the characteristics of Taoist wellness? People often only focus on the well-being of their bodies, but Taoist medicine offers a holistic approach of cultivating not only physical, but also mental and spiritual well-being.

Taoism teaches us to become aware of Qi (pronounced chee), the universal life energy that flows through and sustains all things. By becoming aware of the Qi within us, we can cultivate our Qi, learn how to let it flow unobstructed, and learn how to balance our own life force with the life force of other living beings and of Nature itself. Taoist wellness teaches us that true health and well-being comes from balance and harmony--with oneself, with others, and with our environment.

&amp;#x200B;

Please comment and share what this makes you feel or think? And do you practice the same way as Taoism has been for a long long time?"

taoism,Opinions on tattoos,"Hi all  
I was just wandering on everyones opinion on tattoos, speceifically with a Taoist theme. I personally have a tattoo like this on my arm, it's out of sight on a general daily basis as it's my inner forearm, I'm typically the only person who sees it unless i have my shirt off or short sleeves which is rare. \~  
I came to find that in a local taoist community I got a lot of backlash when they found out I had this tattoo ( It's not a new thing, I've had this for about 4years now and they only saw it a week ago.) saying how wrong it is to have on my body.  But similarly other groups I've been in seem to think it's a nice thing to have and several of them have something similar.  
So i just wanted to put the question over to you guys, do any of you have tattoos? are you against people having them? or do you think that it's just personal preference?  


Thanks -

taoism,How social do you think a person should be?,"Life is certainly about balance. However, sometimes I really crave to be around other people, even if I've been socialising pretty much all day, then I feel somewhat conflicted about being self-dependant but also respecting my own urges.  


Is it a process of learning to be at peace by yourself? Or should we say fuck it &amp; embrace the social creatures that we are?"
taoism,The truth cannot be learned. What can be learned is not the truth.,"What can be learned is 2+2=4. This is useful knowledge for life.

However, 2+2=4 is not truth. Where there is 2 there is 1 and 1. Where did 2 come from? You made the 2. How did the 2 and 2 become separate 2s? You decided they were apart. How did the 1s and 2s become separate from other 1s and 2s? You excluded them. How did the 1s and 2s become separate from the area around them? You decided to itemize them. 

2+2=4 is a perspective. It is a useful perspective.

No matter if you see the same situation but learn it 1+3=4, 3+1=4, 2+1+1=4, or something else, you are only learning another perspective. 

Again, the perspective is useful. Many are ""right.""

What you are looking for is that from which the perspective emerges; that which sees the perspective. You are looking for that which sees or notices the thoughts or words that describe that which is seen.

When you find it, you have returned to the nothing from which you came. This is the limitless being that you are, capable of producing tremendous positivity and negativity, strength and weakness, left and right, up and down. You are the center of all. You are the Tao.

How does one live a life in the world of things and then return to the center of nothing from which it came? I'm not exactly sure, unfortunately. I seem to go back and forth between the two. Maybe our fellow redditors can show the way. "
taoism,Lao-Tzu and Confucian (Story One)," A low ranking court official from Sate Chen visited State Lu, and talked to Lord C-Sun privately. C-Sun told this official, ""Our state has a sage.""   


The official asked, ""Is that Confucius?""   


""Yes,"" C-Sun answered.   


The official asked, ""How do you know he is a sage?""   


C-Sun said, ""I often heard his disciple say that Confucius uses his form, the body, without using his wisdom."" In his later years, Confucius had reached a state of perfection: He followed the dictates of his heart, and whatever he desired was within the boundaries of righteousness.   


Then the official said, ""My state has a sage too. Don't you know?""   


""What is this sage's name?"" C-Sun asked.   


""He is Lao Tzu's disciple Master G-Mulberry, and he has obtained the Tao. He can see with his ears and hear with his eyes.""   


The king of State Lu was very surprised to learn this, and invited Master G-Mulberry to visit with the ritual formality reserved for top court officials. When the Master came, the king humbly asked him about this miracle.   


The Master replied, ""The spreading legend has mixed it up. I cannot exchange the functions of eyes and ears but I can see and hear without the use of ears and eyes.""   


The king said, ""That is even more miraculous. How can you do so? I would really like to know it from you.""   


The Master answered, ""My body unites with the heart, my heart unites with energy, my energy unites with the spirit, and my spirit unites with the Non-Being. Even a tiny existence or the softest whisper as far away as beyond the boundaries of the universe and as close as between my eye lashes, I will know immediately if they are coming to interfere with my existence. I do not know if it is my five faculties of sense or my internal organs that have this ability to sense but I can know it anyway.""   


The king was very happy and told Confucius a few days later. Confucius smiled but said nothing. Confucius had the rule of four no-comments in his teaching and counselling practice: He never talked about parapsychology, psychic power, mental disturbance, and ghosts. "

A person of great virtue is like the flowing water. Water benefits all things and contends not with them. It puts itself in a place that no one wishes to be and thus is closest to Tao. A virtuous person is like water which adapts itself to the perfect place. His mind is like the deep water that is calm and peaceful. His heart is kind like water that benefits all. His words are sincere like the constant flow of water. His governing is natural without desire which is like the softness of water that penetrates through hard rocks.

I have been using many techniques to find which one I truly come to relation with. I stumbled around a bit and researched some methods to try out and came across a few. The ones I have found that have me feeling better after a session of mediation are of the following: 

1) Visualizing Peaceful Imagery. (Sitting on a cloud or something similar)

2) Using some sort of soothing music playing in the background. (This helps people that like to figit and hard to keep still)

3) Experiencing Joy during the higher state of awareness. (Why do something you don't enjoy)

4) Repeating Mantras of specific yet warming terms (Heart, Harmony, Tranquility, etc..) from each breath you take and exhale you let go. 

Please let me know how you do your meditations and if these helped you at any way shape or form. I love the interaction between fellow Taoists. The conversations are very insightful. "

taoism,Conviction vs. Wu Wei,"I recently got back into doing community theatre after a long hiatus and have since joined the board of directors thinking I could change the theatre for the better. Now I sit here thinking that I'm only trying to grasp at the sand that's slipping through my fingers. (My childhood memories)

This is basically what I'm struggling with; are my old memories blocking my growth?

I joined the theatre as a kid doing tech stuff and left around high school because I was busy. Nothing out of the ordinary. Then came back last year and enjoyed working on the shows. But then I found out they want to sell. The building itself is on the heritage list, which means that it's old and the city may consider protecting it. But a developer wants the land because my city is overdeveloping and land is becoming scarce. So, they have to move or fight. I went to the board meeting and everyone just seemed to be a push over and no one seems to want to fight the city. I even took it to the Vice-president and she just thinks that selling is easier.

To me it feels like returning to an old friend but the old friend is riddled with cancer and is begging to die. (Sorry if that is a bit graphic) Do I just shoot them in the head and be humane (walk away) or do I stay with them until the end? (Fight knowing that no one else may even side with me).

I want to fight but I also think that I won't get the support and this could lead me to be ruining friendships that I've been building up with people there over the past year.

Should I just let it go? (I'm also on the board for my resume, I won't lie, I could just stay for that boost later on)

Examples aren't hard to find of it being used poorly.

BUT

德 (de, excellence) comes from practice, diligence, vigilance, doing what it is not in your ape-nature to do.

I've said here before than the difference between a Buddhist and Daoist is the former is attached to non-attachment, or to say it another way they desire to be without desire. You can wrestle with this paradox or laugh at it, and then wrestle with it knowing it's just a futile game.

Don't fall into that trap. Don't use Daoism as an excuse to do nothing because you're just ""going with the flow"". Discipline is natural too, because it's human to cultivate things, including the self.

taoism,Participating in fantasy and imagination makes me hate my own reality.,"I've been struggling with this thought for longer than a year now and it's kind of been a push back and restriction on what I can and can't enjoy. Basically my mind has convinced me that enjoying any form of mythology, fantasy or imagination in video games, movies or even music is counter productive, and it makes me feel as though our reality should be like the wonderful fantasy worlds we come up with. But Taoism has helped a bit a diffusing this by separating the idea of me being separate from my environment. My issue is that I have problems with playing video games and then returning to reality because It makes me feel as though our reality is mundane compared to the fantasy worlds and it sends me down a horrible depressing spiral of negativity. Any advice from a taoist perspective as it has helped me with many other issues? "

A famous Zen Master once wrote:


""There is no enlightenment without practice.""


But that which is, needs no affirmation. It is the foundation, readily perceived and experienced without effort or contrivance.


Simply, it is here, now. Nothing can separate us from the nature of existence.


Why must we practice? Conduct rituals? Repeat mantras and read books? Sit in meditation, wake up at the same hour daily?


How much merit is there to the concept of the "" no-vehicle"" school?(for those who don't know, this is the endlish translation of a Buddhist sect which professes there is no ""way"" to attain enlightenment).

Each of the five sections of the meditation is practiced on or shortly after the beginning of the season.

谭晋玄，邑诸生也。笃信导引之术，寒暑不辍。行之数月，若有所得。

Tan Puxuan was born in Zhuyi and earnestly believed in the art of Dao Yin. Whether hot or cold he never stopped and kept going for many months.

一日方趺坐，闻耳中小语如蝇，曰：「可以见矣。」开目即不复闻；合眸定息，又闻如故。谓是丹将成，窃喜。

One day when he was seated cross legged he heard a small voice speaking from his inner ear that said “can you see me?”

he opened his eye and didn’t hear it again. Then he closed his eyes and set his breath and again heard it. He believed that this was the effect of elixir forming and was secretly pleased with himself.

自是每坐辄闻。因俟其再言，当应以觇之。

So every time he sat he would always listen, waiting for it to speak again, he spied on it.

一日又言。乃微应曰：「可以见矣。」俄觉耳中习习然似有物出。

One day it spoke again saying “can you see me?” and he felt as though something was slowly emerging from within his inner ear.

微睨之，小人长三寸许，貌狞恶，如夜叉状，旋转地上。

He looked carefully at the little man who was three Cun in length.

It was disgusting and ugly like a little demon whirling about on the ground.

心窃异之，姑凝神以观其变。忽有邻人假物，扣门而呼。小人闻之，意甚张皇，绕屋而转，如鼠失窟。

He was terribly startled and collected himself to observe whether it would change forms. Suddenly his neighbour came to bring him something and knocked at the door. The little person heard and alarmed, he scurried out of the room like a mouse hiding in its hole.

谭觉神魂俱失，复不知小人何所之矣。遂得颠疾，号叫不休，医药半年，始渐愈。

Tan felt as though he had lost his spirit entirely and did not know where the little person had gone. He immediately became horribly ill and cried out without ceasing. Only after taking medicine for half a year did he gradually begin to recover."
taoism,The Tao that can be spoken of is not the eternal tao.,"&gt;”I was at a student's house and I see this book. Its one of these photo books that people would put on coffee tables. What's interesting is that there's nothing by the photographer, the author of the book, but there is an intro, a preamble by Tony Morrison who is a fairly important person in the world of art and literature. This tells you that this is a significant book but there is nothing by the person who actually took the photos, in other words the photos have to speak for themselves.

&gt;Its this huge book of photographs and I start to look through these photographs. These are all portraits and I'm like freaking out because its very evident to me what this book is about and I had never seen a book like this, ever. I go to my friend and say, ”This book is amazing!” and she says, ”The photographer, is a distant relative of mine”. ”Well, can you get his telephone number?”, I asked. 

&gt;We called him up and he was there. I told him what I thought his book was about and he freaked out. He said that I was the only person who ever understood what the book was about, of all the people that had seen it at exhibitions or whatever. The name of the book is A Kind of Rapture by Robert Bergman. He went through the rust belt of United States, the old decaying cities, photographing street people, who for whatever reason, usually a combination of hard life and physical, and mental illness, had been thrust into a no-self state, in other words, people for whom the blows of life had driven them to a rapturous no-self experience.

&gt;He went around the country looking for those kind of people, catching them at the moment when they manifested the non-ego, that their hard life had taken them to. You know, if you see one or two pictures like that it doesn't have an impact like that but if you see 50 pictures like that, picture after picture after picture, then it hits you, what the whole thing is about. 

&gt;The reason why I thought they were so extraordinary is that althought there is a lot of books about enlightenment or no-self coming about through practice, and there are number of books written by people who have had spontaneous enlightenment experiences, what no one has looked at is this whole thing, this whole other aspect. 

&gt;In terms of a subject matter it is very unsual and the message is very unsual, and the medium is very unsual, instead of writing a book, talking about this phenomena, he shows it to you and you either get it or you don't.”

One day he passed a wealthy merchant’s house. Through the open gateway, he saw many fine possessions and important visitors. “How powerful that merchant must be!” thought the stonecutter. He became very envious and wished that he could be like the merchant.

To his great surprise, he suddenly became the merchant, enjoying more luxuries and power than he had ever imagined, but envied and detested by those less wealthy than himself. Soon a high official passed by, carried in a sedan chair, accompanied by attendants and escorted by soldiers beating gongs. Everyone, no matter how wealthy, had to bow low before the procession. “How powerful that official is!” he thought. “I wish that I could be a high official!”

Then he became the high official, carried everywhere in his embroidered sedan chair, feared and hated by the people all around. It was a hot summer day, so the official felt very uncomfortable in the sticky sedan chair. He looked up at the sun. It shone proudly in the sky, unaffected by his presence. “How powerful the sun is!” he thought. “I wish that I could be the sun!”

Then he became the sun, shining fiercely down on everyone, scorching the fields, cursed by the farmers and laborers. But a huge black cloud moved between him and the earth, so that his light could no longer shine on everything below. “How powerful that storm cloud is!” he thought. “I wish that I could be a cloud!”

Then he became the cloud, flooding the fields and villages, shouted at by everyone. But soon he found that he was being pushed away by some great force, and realized that it was the wind. “How powerful it is!” he thought. “I wish that I could be the wind!”

Then he became the wind, blowing tiles off the roofs of houses, uprooting trees, feared and hated by all below him. But after a while, he ran up against something that would not move, no matter how forcefully he blew against it – a huge, towering rock. “How powerful that rock is!” he thought. “I wish that I could be a rock!”

Then he became the rock, more powerful than anything else on earth. But as he stood there, he heard the sound of a hammer pounding a chisel into the hard surface, and felt himself being changed. “What could be more powerful than I, the rock?” he thought.

He looked down and saw far below him the figure of a stonecutter.”"

But how can I achieve a state of actually stopping myself from worrying or thinking of the past and learn to live a life lived in the moment.

taoism,"How do the Daoists view the process of death, the afterlife and ghosts?","I think the process is as follows. Please correct any mistakes I have:

1. Ming leaves the body continuously during the lifetime, and rises towards the sky.

2. When all the Ming has left the body and risen towards the sky, the body experiences death, and releases consciousness, known as Xing, which is a conscious ghost. This ghost dwells upon Earth.

After this, I have no idea what happens.

taoism,Question on I Ching casting methods,"A friend was mentioning using I Ching, said she had tossed some coins from her wallet. I had never read or cast I Ching, just what was referenced in Ellen Chen's translation and commentary of the Tao Te Ching (love her book). Anyway, curious, I was reading online and was curious how the coin system developed. Not being a fan of ancient ""civilizations"" and their bloody taxation/coinage governments, I queried older or original methods. I saw the yarrow sticks method and then saw the bamboo or other wood rod method. That gave me an idea to make a rod set for her as a gift. I love woodworking and have some gorgeous hardwoods I could use. The cherry would have a nice warm color and show the wood burning for the hexagram designs.

Before I began this project, I wondered if any of you had ever used the rod casting method, how do you like it?"

Each movie has specific scenes that even speak relatively to Taoist philosophy, a real heart to heart moment.   What really shines is the humble personality and approach in life with the constant struggle of balancing family, friends, and Kung fu. 


The movies are well made too. Great action and story. Quality stuff. "

taoism,Am I taking Vipassana meditation out of it's original context?,"I don't know where else to ask this, but I feel like this sub might be the best place. I realize this is a question specifically about a Buddhist practice, but this sub seems to be both pretty knowledgeable about Buddhism while also not being Buddhist.  
  
I have been practicing mindfulness meditation, basically focusing on my breath and watching my thoughts. The more I dig in to the origin of this practice, the more I realize it's Buddhist roots. The more I dig into the Buddhist roots, the more baggage it seems to come with. Of course there are no shortage of Buddhists who wouldn't hesitate to answer this question with a resounding 'YES' and that makes it harder to really unpack my thoughts.  
  
I am not a Buddhist, but I can't deny that this practice has helped me immensely. That makes me wonder, should I take on the more religious baggage? I don't want to. I don't believe it, but how did such a helpful and seeming spiritual practice come from someone? I guess I want to believe there is more to it. I also really struggle with obsessing about these kind of things.  
  
Does anyone know if there are any history that would point to the specific form of meditation (focus on breath, watching thoughts) being developed elsewhere? I want to think of it as a universal tool . I just feel like to admit that it is a powerful meditation technique means I have to admit and believe a myriad of things in the Buddhist tradition that I don't necessarily believe, nor do I want to.

taoism,Going with the flow vs. stopping compulsive behavior,"I'm struggling to reconcile an aspect of Taoist philosophy with my personal life and let me say upfront it may be completely semantics.  
  
Basically, I've recognized many compulsive behaviors in my life. Compulsive eating, compulsively looking at my phone, compulsively playing video games, etc. and I've realized recently that in the past I think I've used Taoism as an excuse to not work on these behaviors even though in the long run they are just straight up not good for me. Basically, going with the flow = doing whatever you feel.  
  
How do you reconcile the idea of spontaneity and flowing with the fact that we are evolutionary wired to crave certain things? If I just let myself ""go with the flow"" I'm never going to work on these things? What even is the flow?  
  
If you were in Germany in 1933, would the best thing to do be to just follow the flow? I'm not going to lie this is a part of Taoism that I've struggled with the most. I feel like I can't resolve the philosophy without using word games. Like coming up with different definitions of ""the flow"" to make things fit.  
  
Can someone help me articulate better? Is there a fundamental misunderstanding I'm making? Is it simply semantics around what ""the flow"" is? Going with the flow surely doesn't mean discarding all discipline?  
  
I really enjoy being mindful, watching my thoughts and STOPPING MYSELF FROM GRASPING THEM. I feel like Taoist philosophy teaches that if your compulsion is to grab thoughts you should just do it. Just like eating sugar, my natural reaction is to eat as much sugar as I can, but this is an evolutionary trick. I need to stop myself. I need to do the ""unnatural"" thing and limit my sugar, but this seems like something Taoist philosophy would frown on. Can someone correct me if I'm looking at it wrong?"

It’s something the one puts effort into in order to better themselves and the world. It doesn’t feel like the one is going against the grain, but with it. It’s a natural passion in one’s heart that offers its brilliance to others. It could be anything one engages in, there is no right thing. It’s what the one feels naturally pushed towards to do, it doesn’t matter why, it is Tao expressing itself through the one, through the work they are eager to pursue. Humbly producing a mastery of one’s craft. Contemplating and working towards bettering the self as a tool for others.

Once there was a young man who worked at a factory. His mentor, an old technician, taught him to talk less, do more, and never stop developing his skills in every aspect of the factory’s operation.



Ten years later, the old man retired, and the young man became a technician himself. He continued to do his work with the same dedication and diligence as he was taught.




One day, he visited with his mentor. The old man saw that he seemed unhappy, and asked what was troubling him.




The young man sighed and poured his heart out: “I have been following your instructions exactly all these years. No matter what I work on, I keep quiet and focus on the job. I know I have done good work at the factory, and I have learned all the skills that can be learned there. What I don’t understand is that the guys who don’t have my experience or capabilities have all been promoted, while I am still making as little as I did before, when I was your apprentice.



The old man asked: “Are you positive that you have become indispensable to the factory?”



The young man nodded: “Yes.”




The old man paced back and forth to think. After a while, he turned to the young man: “You must request a day off, using whatever reason you like. It’s time for you to give yourself a break.”




The young man was surprised by this advice, but the more he thought about it, the more it made sense. He thanked his teacher and left quickly to make a time-off request.



When he returned to work after his day off, the Manager called him into the office to tell him that things did not go well at the factory while he was gone. Others encountered many problems that normally would be handled by him, and they had no idea how to solve them. Realizing his importance, the Manager decided to promote him to the position of Senior Technician, to thank him and encourage him to keep up the good work.




The young man was grateful for his mentor’s wisdom. Surely, he thought, this was the secret to success!



From that point on, whenever the young man felt like he deserved more than what he was getting, he would take a day off. When he came back the next day, the situation would improve to his satisfaction.




This pattern continued for months. One day, the young man found that he was blocked from going into the factory. Much to his shock, he found out that his employment was terminated. He could not believe it. Not knowing what else to do, he went back to see his mentor, to try to figure out how things had gone so wrong.




“Why did I lose my job?” he asked with much wounded pride. “Did I not do everything as you instructed?”




“Actually, you did not, because you heard only half the lesson,” the old man shook his head. “You understood right away that no one pays any attention to a light bulb that is always on. It is only when it goes off that people suddenly take notice and realize they’ve been taking it for granted. You were so eager to apply this understanding that you left before hearing the second half.”




“Second half?” it began to dawn on the young man that perhaps he made a big mistake. “What was the second half?”




The mentor spoke slowly to make his point: “The second half, more important than the first, is the realization that if a light bulb goes off frequently, then sooner or later it will be replaced with one that is more reliable. Who wants a light bulb that no one can count on to provide illumination?”

taoism,Daily Tao 21/08/2018,"Taoist story - The other side of the river



Once upon a time in ancient China, there was a ferryman who worked along a stretch of the Yangtze river. There were several villages and towns on both sides of the river, so he had steady business taking passengers from one side to the other. Over the years, this brought him into contact with people from all walks of life.




One day, a villager approached the ferryman as he was waiting for potential passengers by his boat. The villager said: “Sir, perhaps you can help me with a question. I’m thinking about moving to the other side of the river. You are probably quite familiar with the people over there. Can you tell me about them?”




The ferryman was curious: “Why are you thinking about moving? Is there something wrong with your village?”




“My village is horrible,” the villager said. “I am surrounded by the worst people you can imagine, so I do not want to live there any longer than necessary. My neighbors make noise when I need quiet. They do not care about the streets being dirty. They have no respect for me. Therefore, I also have no respect for them.”




“That does sound horrible,” the ferryman sympathized. “Have you ever let them know how you feel?”




“Oh, absolutely!” The villager said, with much anger: “I give them unmistakable signs! They disturb me during the day, so I make noise to disturb them at night. They never clean the streets, so I push my trash out the door to teach them a lesson. Whenever they are rude to me, I am rude to them twice as much. Of course they know how I feel!”




“I see,” the ferryman nodded. “Well, I have bad news for you. The people on the other side of the river are not so different from the ones in your village. You will find all the things you dislike about your neighbors quite prevalent there too. If you decide to move, you’ll expend a lot of time and effort, only to end up in the same situation.”



“I knew it!” the villager exclaimed in frustration, and started walking away. “There must be a better place somewhere. I’ll find it!”





Moments later, another man, much younger than the first, approached the ferryman. “Excuse me,” he said, “I am thinking about moving to the other side of the river. You are probably quite familiar with the people over there. Can you tell me about them?”




Again the ferryman expressed curiosity: “Why are you thinking about moving?”




The young man said: “I would like to study spiritual teachings with a Tao sage who lives on the other side. If I move closer to him, I can save a lot of time crossing back and forth. However, I am a little reluctant to leave my home over here.”




“Why the reluctance?”





“My village is a wonderful place to live,” the young man beamed. “I have the best neighbors you can imagine. Everyone is kind and considerate, and we are always looking out for one another. Everyone works to keep the neighborhood clean and make it a pleasant environment. There is much mutual assistance and respect, and that is why I am reluctant to leave. I am just not sure I can find such great neighbors when I’m on the other side of the river.”





“I see,” the ferryman nodded. “Well, I have good news for you. The people on the other side are not much different from the ones in your village. You will find all the qualities you like about your neighbors just as prevalent over there. If you do decide to move, it won’t take you long to become part of a community in the new place that you will enjoy.”





The young man was happy to hear this. He thanked the ferryman profusely before heading back home, to start planning his move.



A nearby street vendor, who had been watching quietly all this time, came over as the young man left. He said to the ferryman: “I could not help but overhear the conversations you just had. It’s especially interesting to me, since I know those two fellows. They come from the same village, and both of them asked the same question. Why did you give them such different answers?”




“The difference came from them, not from me or the place,” the ferryman said. “The first villager is unaware that all the things he hates originate from within himself: the noisy disturbance, the dirty environment, the lack of respect, and so on. His environment reflects what is already in his heart. Unless he changes himself internally, he will continue to recreate the same negative setting no matter where he goes.




“It was similar with the young man,” the ferryman continued. “He may not realize it, but all the things he enjoys about his neighborhood also originate from his heart: the kindness, the consideration, the mutual assistance and respect, and everyone pitching in for the greater good. As long as his positive nature does not change, he will always create the same positive setting no matter where he goes.”





“Ah, I see,” the street vendor smiled in comprehension. “So… things are not necessarily better on the other side?”




“No,” said the ferryman, “but things definitely get better on every side… when they get better on the inside.”

“How do you treat others?” Asks the Master to the new class.
“Treat others as you would want to be treated yourself,” the disciples shout almost in unison.



The Master, nevertheless, did not seem to resonate.  Without commenting on what they say, the Master goes on to tell a story of Zhuangzi.


“Once upon a time, there was an extraordinary bird who flew from the sea and landed on the countryside of a small kingdom.  It was large, beautiful and elegant. People simply called it the Sea Bird. The King soon got wind of it and ordered to have it brought to the palace.



He was astounded by the beauty of the bird. He liked the bird so much that he decided to give it whatever royal treatments he himself had been bestowed. In addition to the elegant abode in the palace temple; he had his musicians played the best music for its amusement and his chefs prepared royal feasts for its consumption.




The Sea Bird, unfortunately, was not at all impressed. On the contrary, it was thoroughly confused. It was frightened by the sound and depressed by its captivity. Despite the King’s best effort, it refused to eat the fine meat and drink the vintage wine.



After three days, it died.
The King was upset. He honored the Sea Bird with the best music and feasted it with the best food. What he got, however, was a melancholy and unappreciative guest.”



“What have you learned from the story of the Sea Bird?” The Master asks the class.



The class is in total silence.
“The King’s good intention is poisonous to the Sea Bird,” sighs the Master. “He’s so naive, not knowing that the Sea Bird is happy only if it’s allowed to live its own nature.”



“So treat others as you would want to be treated yourself,” says the Master. “If you don’t like others to impose their will on you, don’t do this to others.”"

My teachings are simple; if you try to make a religion or science of them, they will elude you.

Profound yet plain, they contain the entire truth of the universe.


Those who wish to know the whole truth take joy in doing the work and service that comes to them.

Having completed it, they take joy in cleansing and feeding themselves.

Having cared for others and themselves, they then turn to the master for instruction.


This simple path leads to peace, virtue, and abundance.

-	Chuang Tsu is using Confucius as a speaker for Taoist thinking because he was considered an authority (and this was tradition)
-	Taoism and Confucius are actually far more similar than modern interpretations sometimes suggest. Thus, when Confucius speaks in these chapters, we can assume he’s speaking from the Dao. 

Perhaps I’m too dense or not yet read enough to see the mocking, because I can’t actively identify it. I’m tempted to take the third interpretation, but then I recall a perhaps incorrect idea about the differences between the approaches. I’ve been surprised how many answers to this question seem opaque (including when it was brought up on “What’s this Dao about” on Show 17)

In short, which is it? Or, put another way, what was Chuang Tsu’s intent?"

taoism,Daily Resources and Practice?,"Question I have what do others use on a daily basis for inspiration and practice?

For instance, I have an app that reminds me everyday to read a random passage from the Tao Te Ching. I often listen to podcasts (recently What is this Tao all about) on my way to work. Also, I read some book relating to cultivating better practice and understanding of Taoist philosophies, etc. Along with those more common items, I’ve kept a journal on my daily or weekly experiences, meditate when the opportunity presents itself, and visit the subreddit to hear from others.   I never force the practice but let it happen with the flow of my days and weeks. 

Since my neighborhood doesn’t have temples or any resource for that matter, I have to strive to inspire myself. Thus I’m always interested to hear what others also do that I could learn from. "
taoism,Water ways,"The flow of life {which is the balance of all existence to me} is the essence of water. We mostly all agree to some extent of that. That’s why we use the term flow. In many different languages. 

The way I approach it is:
The ocean takes a beating from the sun.. in that, the water is not degraded or damaged, just transformed - dispersed- 
Yet it still remains it’s quality -in different form.
The water doesn’t care, the sun can “abuse it”- 

In dispersing- the completeness of what water truly is {what it boils down to}- 

regathers somewhere out of the environment the harsh rays of the sun has created. 

Softly- peacefully- like floating on a cloud ☁️ 
-In this form, the water doesn’t just drizzle rain ☔️ 

Nah- it storms at times ❄️❄️⛈❄️❄️

And the ocean 🌊 knows it’s coming. 

- that storm isn’t negative- it’s aggressive energy that is a natural emergent property or byproduct of coming back together and re-entering this realm. 

- it is apart of the polarity of the flow- 

“The storm doesn’t last forever” 

Once the water has re-entered this realm-
It blesses the earth which in turn bless the world. 

Clouds part 

Rainbows form 

Green gets greener

Life blossoms.

The water covertly at times seep through the earth’s forms and cracks while it makes its way back to the stream of the flow.

- to become ocean again- 

A lot of philosophies and analogies are rooted in this. 

Yet- it’s the approach of how even after the harsh ray’s influence that’s in(only in-at a moments time) that place, that area, or level, is where you had to disperse in and from. 

Yet in doing so you ‘remained’ your quality and in coming back you multiply. 

Essentially you’re “more water” than you were when you dispersed. 

See how’s there’s no individuality to that?

Even the rain drops aren’t individual- neither are the snowflakes ❄️ which literally have a unique form-
Only when in that temporary form. 

Rain nor snow will fall until there is some random particle in the sky that it can form around- just consider that.. 

- all the properties and characteristics of water are like the flow. 

Softly shaping stone;
Sharply cutting metal;
Powerfully flowing through dams;
Ir’respectfully destroying -now obsolete-man made structures by influence of the storm - which was influenced by the flow-

It takes the form of it’s container

It finds the path of least resistance- always."

taoism,"What does it mean to ""hold onto the one""?",
taoism,Daily Tao 15/08/2018,"Chapter 77 of the Tao Te Ching



As it acts in the world, the Tao
is like the bending of a bow.
The top is bent downward;
the bottom is bent up.
It adjusts excess and deficiency
so that there is perfect balance.
It takes from what is too much
and give to what isn't enough.



Those who try to control,
who use force to protect their power,
go against the direction of the Tao.
They take from those who don't have enough
and give to those who have far too much.



The Master can keep giving
because there is no end to her wealth.
She acts without expectation,
succeeds without taking credit,
and doesn't think that she is better
than anyone else.

taoism,Self Doubt,"A lot of posts and comments mention this subject- this may help some of you. 
Your inner existence, which is your life energy, is connected to “your creator” (whatever or whomever YOU define that as). it is a collection of that source energy.

When you plug an appliance into a socket, you’re getting a collection of electrical energy, not all the energy from that source, just a unique collection of that energy.  Which means it’s (the appliance) tapped into or tethered to it.

Well to keep it simple, you are the same way. thankfully your source of energy will never deplete. The connection between that energy source and the human apparatus may discontinue, may be lost, but the energy goes back to the source, or to its original form until allocated again. Like unplugging an appliance.
 
The point is you have direct access to the source. Not like you have to put in a code or degrade yourself for it to be revealed. It’s more like just return to it. 

The appliance didn’t make itself “worthy” of the source, it was created, through that source energy.  Therefor it inherently has access to it. YOU connected it {to power} by YOUR choice.. electricity didn’t pass judgment or weigh in, it just allowed it’s essence to flow and if the appliance is properly tapped into it, the source will flow through it, until disconnected. If the appliance isn’t compatible, source doesn’t shun it, or judge it in any way.. it’s just not currently (no pun.. well maybe) compatible. Go back, make it compatible or get a new appliance lol.  {are you still tracking?}

The source follows the way and the way follows source 

Can’t locate or tap into what you don’t know exists though. Can’t arrive at a desired location that you don’t *believe* exist. (Ponder on that)  {w/o intellect}

All the answers you seek can be accessed internally. Tell me, “easier said than done” or “impossible” and I’ll 🤷‍♂️ say ok.. then just look at you lol. ... *blink...blink* 🦗

-Understanding and teaching (learning)  are all accomplished by you. There are guides (external)- but you have to make the information relevant to your life and current level of understanding to learn it.


*Your emotions guide you*. 

It’s crazy that we all know that, yet we question it. That’s because we have spent too much time identifying with things that aren’t us. Like the mind. If you think with the physical mind (or should I say operate THROUGH-), that’s like allowing your computer or smart phone to tell you what is real (internet, media-we do) or what’s not. How to feel, how to act because of the “facts of something”. 

The mind, like a computer, is a tool that expands and evolves based off of what YOU program it to do. It’s purpose is to complete patterns, direct signals and assist in analysis for YOU to then realize the current reality you exist in, in that moment. 

If you give your focused energy to the mind, then add in the emotional energy of  *belief* {energy that follows the concept of belief), it will lead you somewhere, give it to the source of your energy, it will guide you somewhere. 

Home stretch- made easy- if I want or desire something or to do something, and it feels GOOD to me, not just {satisfactory} then I’ll do it, if not I won’t. If Im in the process and an “external factor” tells me that I can’t do this- lets say gravity (or a person -named gravity) - then I’ll build an airplane and say “yes I can- ok- bye 👋” 

 Not because I think I’m in the right- yet because I KNOW who and what I am. No one knows my truth but me. Like you, I’m the only one living this perspective- from day one, so who can judge my understandings? I’m a product of my environment and all my unique experiences- ALL of them. 

.. and like “truth” I won’t remain the same- forever expanding. "

You leave your home to run errands- your phone still has the WiFi settings on-

Some networks require effort for you to join- the know how- 

Some will let you hop right on, ANYONE can - no security within-

Moral- rings with a previous post of mine - if you’re not connected to something, you can connect to anything.. 

If you understand biology- that makes you a “ free radical”.. those are cancerous - if you didn’t know. 

Allowing your phone to constantly attempt to connect to just anything that you come by- is a waste of energy- complete waste. 

Turn off your WiFi settings (and Bluetooth) until you actually, consciously want to connect to something- deliberately lol. As to not waste energy and to not find yourself in a “collective consciousness” (energy accompanied with emotions) that you didn’t intend on tapping into.

Joy can’t be great without a little bit of sadness 

But that’s it- just a little 

Confusion only last as long as you riddle-

-Say what you say

And mean what you mean
in deliberate gait

For these thin lines we walk - no one reads between -
Cause’ like streams  - all they want they can dream- yet they still can’t sea. 

All aboard -

It’s your journey - 

that’s all

taoism,"Question regarding some personal ""contradictions"" I am facing with Taoism","Hi guys. I am kind of new into Taoism so sorry If I ask something stupid. I have read the Tao Te Ching, the Hua Hu Ching (I know the controversy of this book)  and I am currently reading the Zhuangzi apart from other books regarding the history and roots of Taoism. I like to study philosophy but I found myself not being able to understand some taosist concepts. I will mention the term Wu Wei although I understand that is a very complex idea (sorry If I use it wrong). 

First is the seeking of inmortallity. The major part of the time the term inmortallity for me means being one with the Tao but other times seems to pretend some kind of transcendence (like what buddhist seek) or longevity and a lot of Taoist schools seems to look for this. Isn't this goal pure ego and opposite to the natural flow of the Tao and Wu Wei?

Secondly, what would a taoist do if he face an ""evil"" (murderer or rape for example) action and he could stop it. Should he do it? I would like to know the taoist explanation regarding this kind of issues.

And this brings my last question very related to the second question. Why is the middle point and the Wu Wei the taoist path? If we accept nature as it is then all actions are ""natural"" cause if not those actions would not be able to be performed (follow the flow of the river or changing it are both equal actions cause you are a natural force emerged from the Tao, balance is not better than unbalance). Abandoning your ego and desires should be as ""good"" or ""bad"" as having them so the wu wei path is just a choice and the other paths should be equal. Trying to keep a balance of those two energies is as valid as unleash them both. I find taoism not even in the middle point, trying to balance them, it seems very aligned into the ""positive"" path in a lot of his teachings but if ""positive"" and ""negative"" are equal and they complement each other, why even promoting anything ""positive""? Then, it seems that the path you follow is just the type of energy you want to move or preserve (cause all actions: ""good"" or ""bad"", ""passive"" or ""active"" can be justify under a taosit view). 

I am probably very mistaken in these statements, that is why I would like to know your opinions. Thanks."

Not only that, but I haven't ever heard about or seen a taoist temple near where I live. This is the one thing about philosophical taoism that bugs me, it doesn't have any community in which to practice in, and many of the concepts that it talks about require a teacher in order to learn (Wu wei for example). I'm not interested in religious taoism or energy work, and that's the closest I can find to a community which I can join to further my path with the Tao. I always hear people here talk about how essential it is to have a teacher, but I've never seen or heard about a taoist teacher in my area.

taoism,1st chapter,"Is there any fellow newbies (or anyone) who would like to discuss the first chapter with me to seek a deeper understanding of the Tao Te Ching? 

If so- I “desire” to start with the 3rd part -Běnzhāng de dì 3 bùfèn {本章的第3部分}- of the chapter.

I’m looking at several translations so I won’t bother to post them-

the part I want to talk about is the part that’s  says, basically across the board - to be free from desire you will realize the mystery- having desire you will only see what’s manifested - yet mystery and manifestation come from the same place-

When you guys translate &amp;amp;lt;these translations&amp;amp;gt; for yourself, do you use the word desire or ambition? To me, ambition is wanting with the intent and drive to act - to pursue-
While desire to me is a simple wanting- words being limitations- I refer it to preference’ I can prefer without action.

 I believe the nature of all life is to desire, we can’t help but desire, that’s like the metronome of life, once you stop desiring, you stop creating, and when you stop doing that, you’re telling life (IMO) that you’re done, so whenever it wants it’s physical energy back you’re ready to give it.. just watch other animals in the wild, when they let go- or give up - on desire- they die- if they fulfill their mission (reproduction) they tick the starting tock of death.

By taking in the rest of the chapter I believe the energy behind the words are “ambitious energy”- because that’s when you allow yourself to be distracted. To be ambitious is to be physically focused. Manifestation is of the physical reality. Mystery, to me, refers to all that is mystical (non physically manifested) or not of this physical dimension. 

So to be without that, one might ask “so then what’s the point?” Or like “now what?” Well you’re left with - you- imagine we take ourselves away from societal convictions and obligations; remove your “personalities” which are just comparisons to other people. If it’s just you in the world, do you have a personality? Nah, you’re just you. So what is that? To me that’s what this section is trying to get us to tap into, the fullness of who we are, not just the part of us that’s physically focused which gives us life- here- in this common reality, but the full us that comes from the darkness that begat the darkness- the origin or source of life. 

That’s the “mystery” and that mystery has a “way” of being. All things that are born from it are scales of that way. We bring the “feel” into emotion- we place the song into “sing”.  

There is a symphony or a dance happening, we all are an instrument or a dancer of it- to be “physically focused”  is to dance alone (seemingly in one’s own reality) but to be without ambition, you “ realize” {key word to me, not see} the mystery, the collective dance, the symphony. 

Once we have this realization we can clearly see our position in it- dharma/ Dao - we all have a place or position in “the way”- which brings life to “our way” not of doing or acting, yet of “being”/ perceiving / preferring. And this all aids to the expansion of the universe - 

Just like how all the individual sensations our sensory body send throughout our nervous system allowing us to take in our environment as a whole (pending your awareness) and create a “manifested” translation of this realty, causing us to learn through experiences, which begets expansion and evolution.

 - thus we mankind and all other living things - from our perspectives - perceive the world, create preferences and send that back to the source of all- which then expands its existence due to our existing and perceiving from our perspective dance positions. 

And then it delivers unto us- those preferences. “Ask and ye shall receive” type thing. You attract what you place your focus to, because where focus goes, energy flows. You focus on the dance- you find your position- and in that position lie all the answers you seek. 

Haha this is how I translate this and relating things. "

I desperately want to drop the bag.   I'm concerned because if future potential implication when this secret goes public.   She has said that she is going disclose the situation to our supervisor soon.

The other part of my mind is saying, ""what a wonderful opportunity for learning"".  Academically everything I've studied is in play.  Taoism tells me to let the universe flow and the situation will unfold as designed.  Stoicism tells me that this is not in my control and that I shouldn't concern myself things that are not in my control.  Eckhart Tolle says that I'm failing to live in the Now, creating suffering by painting a mental picture of some future event.   If I could apply these teachings I might find patience and peace.

Clearly the academic part of my mind is correct.  I have laid the answers in front of myself and yet I struggle to use these tools to my benefit.  My emotions are clouding my mindset. 

I suppose what I'm asking is how does one strengthen their resolve to the point that it tempers the emotional response?   "

The generals have a saying:
""Rather than make the first move
it is better to wait and see.
Rather than advance an inch
it is better to retreat a yard.""



This is called
going forward without advancing,
pushing back without using weapons.



There is no greater misfortune
than underestimating your enemy.
Underestimating your enemy
means thinking that he is evil.
Thus you destroy your three treasures
and become an enemy yourself.



When two great forces oppose each other,
the victory will go
to the one that knows how to yield.

It'd be cool to have something better than wikihow at least, and super complicated pages on the internet with majority of info written in Chinese, because that's the best I can find so far, haha.

**(I edited this post because I realized it was a bit immature and I wasn't asking a real question, so feel free to ignore the rest below.)**

Original Post:

&gt;*So I'm 25 years old. I managed to make a living self-employed early on with YouTube, and once I had enough funds, I ran away from home (Utah) and tried to get away from everyone I know. It was never easy for me to be too close to anyone, I have no patience and grow bored of people and overwhelmed by their emotions and problems in an instant. I've spent a life hiding in my bedroom, nihilistic and suicidal all my life, and I want things to change.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I recently was very moved by the Tao Teh Ching and want to completely embody its wisdom but have no discipline and no easy access to a teacher. My knees are failing me due to early onset arthritis, and I can't sit due to anxiety-related hemmorhoids/stomach problems, so I feel like I can't even look for guidance from Buddhists (the places I actually CAN access from where I am, a Zen Temple and a Tibetan Temple) because meditation hurts my knees -- I need something Taoist like Tai Chi to help ease the arthritis pain. But again, no discipline. I watch YouTube videos of beginners Tai Chi and start following along, but after an hour of motivation I lose all interest and end up meditating on my back, on the floor. The meditation puts me more in the moment but I don't trust myself to continue -- I'm not socializing with any human beings, and, here's a HUGE problem --*  
&gt;  
&gt;*My next door neighbor terrifies me. (He's basically identical to my father who mentally and physically abused me. I can't believe I ended up living next door to someone who literally embodies that which I ran away from in the beginning. Due to the Tao I see him as an opportunity to grow and see where I'm stuck in my mind, but again, no discipline. I can't do it. I'm TERRIFIED of him and it makes me want to die. I don't leave my house because of him. Sometimes I just want to go outside in the morning to be in the light and think about the Tao but all I do is hide in here. He desperately wants to be my friend and tries to guilt me into hanging out with him, trying to give me weed I don't want and saying ""Yeah, you can just hang out with me in return"" or knocks on my door to tell me about a problem he has, so I'll end up talking to him and then he'll beckon me to come in his apartment. I feel so stuck in anxiety).*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I know in reality I can just follow the way, follow my inner compassion, and it'll make sense. I'll stand up and follow the Tai Chi videos. I'll be honest with my neighbor and treat him as my equal. I'll get therapy or something. But every time I meditate enough to start doing this, it gets quickly disrupted by my lack of discipline and I fall into self destructive habits or just lie on the floor giving up.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*When I meditate long enough, I come to realize what my ego truly wants more than anything, is to cry in some intelligent male person's arms and for them to tell me everything will be okay. Don't know why the specifics of that are so, but it seems very linked to my childhood and the abuse. It seems to be my ego's greatest desire, and the most difficult attachment to silence, and it's that attachment that makes me even more desperate for, if nothing else, a teacher who cares about me.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I apologize if this post feels immature, but I don't know where else to ask for opinions. Anyone have any advice? Should I just keep meditating every day until it gets better?*"

taoism,Karma in Taoism,"Hello!
So I wondered how the concept of karma is working in taoism and so I googled it and I found a website which seems to descripes it very good. But then I got to a point where I couldn't follow the autor any more; to be more exactly I struggled with this lines: 
""It is equally possible to accumulate negative Karma, and acquire tremendous power.  However, when an evil person does something positive, that person loses Karma as well!""
Does it mean when an ""evil"" person does something ""good"" he loses ""negative"" Karma or that he keeps losing ""positive"" Karma because he is meant to be ""evil"". I am sorry but I am totally confused right now, and it would be nice if someone could help me to understand that statement or even explain the concept of taoism in his own word!

So, if I were born with the same conditions as President Trump, I would be him. If I were born in the same conditions as Alan Watts, I would have been him. If I were born with the same conditions as a violent Neo-Nazi, I would be him. I often wondered things like, what if I was born into a hippie family, who would I be and now I know. I could be anyone I see or hear about if I were born them. So, now I can see how we all are the same person just experiencing infinite possibilities all at once.

Today, it is hard to understand why children suffer or why some people die lonely and defeated on the street. On a personal level, I could look at my most difficult moment and understand how they changed me, possibly for the better.

So far I've got Western Europe mostly handled but have currently been focusing the bulk of my research on Ancient to Modern China. 

How do Taoism and (Both Neo and Classical) Confucianism differ when it comes to sexuality aspects such as homosexuality, prostitution and such. From what I understand of Ancient China, homosexuality was relatively more acceptable than in the West and prostitution was legal until about the Qing Dynasty and the advent of Neo Confucianism, but the exact differences between Taoist and Classical Confucianian ideals on sex and sexuality as well as sexual morality are sometimes a bit vague, especially regarding things such as homosexuality.

They are on the subject of the sixth lunar month and how we should relate to the differentiation of yin and yang in the environment.
The first post is about the writing of southern school neidan adept xiao yanzhi:

We are well ensconced into the sixth month of the Lunar calendar which is exemplified by the Dun trigram and Wei Branch.
At this time we have already passed the peak of Yang Energy in the environment for more than two months.  Now there are two Yin lines and four Yang lines on top.  Dun is also called 天山卦 heaven mountain hexagram because it is heaven in the sky and mountain on earth.
For our meditation practice, it is common to find that the Qi has a habit of moving up at this time, so it is fine to allow it to do this naturally.
The time of practicing with strong intention is coming to an end and now we should begin to practice in a more ""wu wei"" way, allowing the energy to behave as it will.

Southern school master Xiao Yanzhi wrote about this time and what approach to take.  Here is what he said: 

未（遯卦），六月
Wei (Dun hexagram), the sixth month:

谓之七还五返，
There have been seven changes  and five returns . 
武火临终用一文，
Martial fire is close to the end of its use. 
Begin to use a bit of civil fire.
桃花已落惟留蒂。
The Peach blossom has already fallen back to the root.

All the best in your practice :)

The second post is about King of Medicine, Sun Simiao:
Sun Simiao was a famous doctor known as the king of medicine.  He was also experienced in Daoism  and wrote documents on Waidan and Zuowang practices.  Some of his writing has been translated by Livia Kohn in her book ""sitting in oblivion.""
Here he discusses dietary changes to be made in the sixth lunar month, which we are currently occupying until August 6th.
For those of you more experienced in Chinese medicine than me, please feel free to suggest changes to my translation.

月肝气微，
In the sixth month, the liver Qi is waning. 
脾藏独王。
The Spleen is the only ruler.
宜臧苦增咸，
It is ideal to reduce bitterness and add saltiness. 
节约肥浓，
Cut out fatty and strong foods. 
补肝助肾，
This will mend the liver and help the kidneys. 
益筋骨
And add to muscle and bone.

taoism,Terence McKenna on Taoism,"Just a quote I thought yall would dig...

“To my mind, Taoism is the most refined ideal of human existence. It is open-ended. It always yields to a good laugh. It’s not dogmatic. It’s rooted in nature. \[...\] I see it as the kind of *natural way of being in the world*, that tribally-alive societies settle into, and what we’re trying to recreate. Appropriate activity. That alone would create a world-informing revolution."""

taoism,I've lived in China for 4 years. This week I finally took the leap and entered the Way. Would anyone be interested in hearing about my experience?,"As the title suggests, I've been living in Cangzhou, Hebei, for the last 4 years. Even though it was initially one of the biggest drawing factors for me to come to China, i've always made excuses that prevented me from studying Dao. Until a few days ago, that is, when i found a small temple/shrine on the outskirts of my city and convinced the master there that my Chinese ability was sufficient to learn from him, that my intentions were genuine, and that i will actually be staying in the city long enough to learn anything.

So would anyone be interested in some second-hand knowledge as it is gathered? For example:

* the daily prayers/mantras we must read every morning after waking and before sleeping (Text, translation, and audio recordings)
* breathing exercises/guided meditations
* proper technique for kowtowing/daily rites upon entering the temple
* dietary restrictions
* random facts from/about Shifu/Shiye
* pictures/videos of our temple/practices (where permitted)
* personal reflections/motivations
* etc

Obviously, a lot of the stuff will be specifically tailored for my personal journey but I don't mind sharing, when appropriate.

Feel free to DM me or reply here as you please!

taoism,Buddhism and Taoism from Bruce Frantzis Interview..,
taoism,Fear of Death,"For the longest time I have been plagued by the fear of death. I found the whole idea of dying itself blood-curdling.Yet in time I have been able to shift my perspective on the whole matter and come to new conclusions which helped me to make this 'burden' lighter. I wanted to share this in the hopes helping others to find more inner peace and death acceptance.

Death has been my enemy for a long time; I called it my *Final Boss*. By calling it this I knew all well it was me who was giving it value thus binding myself emotionally to it. My usual trick to free myself of intrusive thoughts is to wave them away by saying 'Do not attach any value to it' to myself as some sort of mantra. The thoughts lose their importance after a while of repeating this. Yet with death it was a different matter, I knew I had to solve the puzzle by looking the beast straight into its eyes, I needed to understand fully what death (and life) meant in order to set myself free.

In order to understand what death is, you have to understand what life is energy-wise (or as an abstraction). Life is pushing and pulling. Cells constantly re-arrange themselves and form bodies, trees, birds etc. The friction of energy this creates can be consciously observed if you focus your attention onto it.(for instance by meditating you can notice tensions in your body, or tensions of a space)I will explain now how this knowledge helped me understand what death is.

A few weeks ago I fell into a meditation while waking up in bed. My body was fully in a relaxed state and my mind was fully awake. I noticed how calm and still my body was in great contrast to the stream of tension(restlessness) in the room. The tension felt like it was moving as if it was water flowing everywhere. Yet my body remained still since I knew that at the core of our being/body there is ultimate stillness(peace/inner rest) to be found. It seems like all the tension in a space gets neutralized when you consciously won't participate in it.

After a while I noticed some thoughts coming up. Instantly with the coming of thoughts my body reacted to this, muscles tensed and it felt like the stream of the environment got a hold on me and tried to infiltrate me with tension/restlessness. When I waved the thoughts away my body got relaxed and the tension neutralized again. Awareness is very physical.When your mind tends to hold onto thinking you get emotional about the thought and in that sense you add value to your thoughts. As soon as you add value to something, you are actually drawn into the turbulence flow. Unrest is a kind of seducer (a tension/a force), it flows continuously and tries to pull you along. Attaching value to things is actually taking part in this troubled current. You blind yourself for the inner silence and put your body in a state of tension instead.

While laying there I realized life is the constant current that pushes and pulls. Dying is detaching/releasing oneself from this process. Some people speak in their NDE's(near death experiences) about a sense of ultimate peace overtaking them; it is the release from that constant stream and returning to the core of inner stillness (rest).In my anxious thoughts of dying I projected a perspective on the matter that I am familiar with (fear). This is an experience / projection of a living person who partakes in the stream of life. I added value to the idea and my body got tense and restless; the idea unconsciously drew me into the current of tension. I needed to shift my perspective on death and realize what life and death actually mean: Life pushes and pulls, death is stillness.It is not resistance that brings us to the core of stillness, it is a non-participation/a state of de-manifestation.  


TLDR; [PiousOwl](https://www.reddit.com/user/PiousOwl) : Life is like rapids and death is like a calm lake

Anxiety/fear of death comes from a projection of what you think death is. In order to release oneself of this fear you need to understand what death and life really are. Life is a restless current. Death is stillness/rest. There isn't much terror in the ultimate form of relaxation."

taoism,How it feels for non-Chinese reader to study Daoism?,"For those who study Daoism academically, they may not need to learn Chinese if they only want to study Daoism at undergraduate level.

But for those who believe in religious Daoism or those who seek some sort of spiritual guidance etc, it's a bit surprising to me that so many of them are fine with the fact that they cannot read Chinese.

For this kind of people, Daoism may influence their values or way of life etc; and many Daoist texts are highly ambiguous, that any reliable translation(s) cannot transfer their full meaning (not to mention there are tons of Daoist texts that have very few to no English translation). In short, non-Chinese reader may not in a good position to study Daoism in depth and to form their own understanding. This is, I believe, a strong reason for this kind of people to learn Chinese.

I think there are many non-Chinese readers in this sub, what is your view on this issue? Do you want yourself to be able to read the original texts? If there is anyone who is learning/has learnt Chinese, please share your experience! Learning Wenyan is probably quite a challenge for westerners.

An example is someone posting something on Facebook that is either flat out wrong or biased in some way.

But then I would be allowing the negativity to continue.

Or someone saying something racist.

Or social intolerances.

Is it better to just stay quiet even if something is wrong? How far might someone go to correct something that is wrong? If someone is incorrect is there a good way to educate them and not embarrass them?

taoism,A poem I wrote,"Feedback welcome


Untitled (currently called Yin AF in my head)

&amp;nbsp;

A tall woman stands at cliff's edge.

Weighty Earth and empty Heaven

tremble in a bare meeting-place.

&amp;nbsp;

A jade river flows by her feet.

It comes from North Mountain's cragged face

cutting stone: high water falling.

&amp;nbsp;

North Mountain sends thin icy breath

That bites and gnaws: it makes her gnarled.

She accepts it, and does not move.

&amp;nbsp;

The wind dances her long, wild hair.

It cycles: growing just to fall

away into a no-mind space.

&amp;nbsp;

Faint sunlight streams through, around her

to reach grass: thick and silent. Now

growing soft leaves like yielding blades.

&amp;nbsp;

In dark pools she watches small fish

clad in quiet silvery quickness

circle and swim, never dying.

&amp;nbsp;

Vaultless, arcing sky is her roof

and changing churned earth is her floor

Bending, she is a green willow."

taoism,Taoist Symbols.,"Hi all,   
I've been reading into Taoist symbols, I figured here would be a good place to ask a few questions.   
1) The ""Yin and Yang"" symbol i have seen in several rotations, is there a reason for the different position? the most common is with he larger white portion to the top and the lager part of the black side to the bottom. Is there a reason the symbol is rotated sometimes?   
2) I've also noticed there different arrangements of the hexagrams around the Yin and Yang. The two main ones that came up a lot were the ""King Wen"" Arrangement and the ""Fu Xi"" Arrangement. What's the reason for the different arrangements? and does either of them carry more weight than the other with their meanings?   


Apologies if I've misunderstood anything while I've been reading around, please do correct me if there is anything wrong or that I've misunderstood. Just a curious mind wanting to find some more knowledge

taoism,"Many times in reading ""Meditations"" I imagine that the world would have opened up to Marcus Aurelius if he had discovered Taoism.","""The universe is either a confusion, and a mutual involution of things, and a dispersion; or it is unity and order and providence. If then it is the former, why do I desire to tarry in a fortuitous combination of things and such a disorder? And why do I care about anything else than how I shall at last become earth? And why am I disturbed, for the dispersion of my elements will happen whatever I do. But if the other supposition is true, I venerate, and I am firm, and I trust in him who governs. "
taoism,Taoist prayers?,"I am very new to the Tao so bear with me.

My mom was recently diagnosed with cancer.  Fortunately, it was caught early and is treatable.  Nevertheless, we as a family are all very concerned.

As a fledgling taoist, how might I ""pray"" in this situation?  I don't think praying to the Tao like a Christian prays to God is possible.  Should I perhaps practice self-directed prayer with the aim to simply be calm and strong for her?

Any advice would be appreciated!

taoism,"What is ""Tao"" in Taoism","So  I know for a fact that Taoism doesn't operate as the same way as Abrahamic religions with a personal god that intervenes; however, I notice in Taoism. They always mention ""Tao"", how Tao created the universe and such, but its not like a God that came from the heavens and such. Is Tao more of a Pantheistic concept or like Brahman which is that it is formless, and everyone is just oneness and is part of the Tao or Brahman? Sorry for my misunderstanding, as I come from a Dharmic faith. Sikhism, and we believe in Whaeguru well similar to Brahman. Whaeguru is unconceivable, everyone thing is apart of Whaeguru, we believe it is timeless, genderless, and formless. We also believe that when we achieve Moksha we merge back to God and such, but I am not sure if Tao is used in a metaphorical sense or in literal sense. Forgive me I mixed up Taoism, as I find it to be an interesting faith or philosophy. As I learnt a lot of interesting things such as the Butterfly dream by  Zhuangzi. It also helped with my fear of death in his book."

taoism,A question about the Taoist view of physical reality.,"I wonder whether in Taoism, reality is considered to be somewhat of an illusion.

I've read that, according to ancient Shamanism and philosophy, reality may be an illusion because of the [Dream argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_argument). I've also read that this idea has been reflected upon in multiple Eastern philosophies/religions. For instance, Hinduism and Buddhism share the concept of Maya, which is the idea that the human perception of reality is far removed from what reality is actually like.

What made me wonder about Taoism was [this article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/dreaming-in-the-digital-age/201802/dreaming-and-waking-which-is-more-illusion), which had the following to say about Taoism and the subject of dreams and reality:

*""In the Daoist tradition of ancient China, dreaming also provided an experiential means of teaching deep spiritual truths. You may have heard this story before, from the Daoist sage Zhuang Zi, and his text The Inner Chapters. One night Zhuang Zi went to sleep and dreamed of being a butterfly, flying freely in the air and knowing nothing of Zhuang Zi. Then he awoke again, and he was undoubtedly Zhuang Zi.  Which raised the question: How could he know if he was a man dreaming of being a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming of being a man? The Daoist answer is, you can’t know; what’s real here is the process of change and transformation, not any one momentary state of being.""*

Could someone explain what the general Tao belief about reality is?"
taoism,Zuowang 'sitting in oblivion' meditation,"Hi all, 

I am researching into zuowang meditation and hoped some members of this sub might be able to advise me. 

I have seen this meditation described as 'formless' and that there are several different ways to practice. From an earlier post on this sub I saw someone describe it as simply focusing on the sensation of breathing whilst letting any thoughts that arise pass by (forgetting?). Would this be correct technique? 

Also, does this meditation have a goal for its practitioners? For example an insight into the nature of things. I have the 'Sitting in Oblivion' PDF downloaded but have not had the time to dedicate to reading it yet. 

I have little chance of finding a teacher at the present moment and was hoping some people that actively practice this meditation might be able to help me with my daily diminishing :)

taoism,"Particularly good section of Alan Watts set to music ""We are all constant patterns...and that's all we are""",
taoism,An interesting observation?,"Over the course of the year, I have lost an interest in food and in music. I enjoy food but it's no longer a thing of excitement in my life, Ive started really enjoying healthier foods for the sake of my health as opposed to eating processed or junk food for the momentary pleasure. Music seems so isolating these days, I just much prefer listening to my surroundings, my absolute favourite thing to listen to is just going to a place with lots of nature and quiet and just sitting and listening to the natural world. Things are also seeming a lot more vivid and whenever I look at green plants/trees with sunlight beaming through I feel so euphoric and happy in my chest and in my eyes. I wouldn't believe it if it weren't true and everyone says I'm mad but I've started feeling very slight vibrations when I touch trees and the earth. I have become very empathetic almost empathic (is that actually a thing?) With people and animals I interact with . 

Could this all be a result of pursuing self development, which inturn lead me to a focus on spirituality and thus Taoism. 

I have been reading and annotating the Tao Te Chang, meditating, pursuing mindfulness,  doing yoga, tai chi, learning about Taoism and associated concepts like chakras, crystals, reiki, the third eye/glands doing other regular exercise, lots of introspective thinking, getting therapy, and focusing on things I love/enjoy/aspire to, as well as spending more time in nature?

It's natural to think that there is one feeling that is ""normal."" That ""normal"" is a great thing; it is how we remember ourselves as we transition through emotions stimulated by change.

taoism,What does Taoism say about the self?,"When I mean self, I refer to the “I”. When someone says, “I am happy”, “I am frustrated”, or anything that implies a personal feeling which also implies a separation from you and the other..to be more specific. 

This realization that my thoughts are not an accurate picture of reality is getting more clear as the days go by, and when it comes to observing what arises and falls in my head, the thoughts which create “me” identity versus the thoughts that describe what is seen appear to merge together, as one. 

Does Taoism cover on the separation that our minds project? The “Dao” is the only way, it is everything, and everything comes from the Dao. I can barely start to see that. But these thoughts which seem to go against Dao arise, because they imply a sort of ground in which it is a separation existence.

taoism,Marijuana and mediation,"For the past few days I've been thinking a lot about meditating on marijuana. I don't smoke but maybe once every few months. Last year when I was starting to experiment with meditation but hasn't looked much into Eastern religion I had mediated while on dabs. It felt trippy and I thought I wanted to try it again.

I looked up different perspectives on it. Perspectives vary from it clouds the mind and prevents one from doing their Dharma to it's ok once in a while but you risk dependency.

I've been completely sober for the last 3 weeks. I was an alcoholic for 7 years, eventually my appetite faded. I experimented with lsd for about a year, drank beer occasionally. Recently I decided to go completely sober and I can think this image I have of myself as always having been on some kind of drug is what's really at the heart of it. I thought I could get high and mediate once a week and still be good.

Of course, a small but growing voice in me know that was shit. Nonetheless I had to try it. I've been meditating seriously for almost a month now and I can say that once you get you where you can do it 30+ minutes, it's better sober. When I actually did my asanas I was slower and more relaxed but I could just go slower when I'm sober.

Anyway I just wanted to share in case there's anyone else seriously considering it, find out for yourself if you have to but in my experience, it's not as fun as you might expect.

I think drugs (including alcohol) have their place. LSD really helped kick start my interest in spirituality, but it can only get you to the gate, you have to go in and you have to explore. Once inside going back to the gate is the opposite of progress."

You don’t know. ..But that doesn’t mean to say that you aren’t doing it in just the same way as you’re breathing without knowing how you breathe.” -Alan Watts

taoism,Acting on instinct,"I often find myself having trouble when I come across a mosquito. If I see them flying within my house I do my best to gently guide them outside. If I see my cat pursuing one I watch for some time and enjoy watching her following her way so intuitively. 

But I run into trouble when surprised by the slight sting of an unexpected bite. I swat reflexively and often find my mark. When it occurs my wife moves to comfort me as she knows I don't enjoy killing the creatures, though I have a deeper internal struggle than mourning their loss. 

I am torn on whether or not I should feel as if I'm acting against the flow of life in these moments. I am not moving out of malice or any calculated action. It is reflex and as such is the natural way of reacting. But should I, being able to recognize my impulse has consequence, instead train myself to fight this instinct?

Thanks to all of you for your suggestions, I picked out some that I'm surely going to read. I have a long car ride tomorrow and I got some of them as audiobooks too, so thank you for adding some spirituality to my driving.

taoism,Is it possible to feel vibrations through the ground or trees by touching them?,"Whenever I place my hand flat on the earth or on a tree I feel very subtle vibrations, similar to an energy current flowing through or a hive of bees. But very subtle.

Ive been doing a lot of meditating lately as well as tai chi, yoga, swimming, Balencing my diet, self reflecting, annotating the Tao Te chang, learning about Taoism, chakras, the third eye/pineal gland, and other spiritual concepts as well as psychology whilst also just in general trying to improve my quality of life.

Is it possible that by doing the above for just over half a year has helped my to feel the energy within the earth and trees? I've also been seeing colours a lot more vividly, and I keep waking up between 3-4 am. But those are just side notes. 

My other theory is that I'm just feeling my blood flow and pulse in my hand. "

taoism,How to handle a difficult person,"Hello dear reader,
today I had a firey discussion with a colleague. I defended my point, but he would always argue against everything I'd say, and when I got more and more worked up, he told me that he had the same opinion as me anyway but kept on going arguing against my point whenever I said something.

I have troubles with this, because I want to accept him as he is, but as he, on one hand, obviously tries to provoque me and seemingly has no opinion on the subject matter that's worth defending, what are my ways out?

I can build a wall between us, but that does not seem to solve my underlying problem that I get worked up when someone pushes my button. It may work in the short term, but then when somebody other pushes my button, I would have to build a wall again. However anger is a form to show someone that you care about something, right? So getting rid of the anger may on one hand not be possible without getting disbalanced, and on the other hand, not be useful, because it might serve me well some day.

Can I just not save myself from this? Is my mood dependent on this person? How do you handle such situations?

taoism,Wufang Shangdi - 五方上帝 - Five Forms of the Highest Deity,"**Forward:** 

Hello. I've not posted here at all but I feel the need now to share what I have been studying with the Taoist community here on reddit. My primary reason for not sharing this was my concern that this knowledge would be either ignored or rejected by what I surmised to be essentially ""*sola scriptura*"" following Taoists. That is, Taoists who see Taoism mainly as a philosophy and not a religion. That is fine. I am not really concerned about being down voted. I am concerned that this information may fall on deaf ears. However, after seeing some of the posts by /u/jamesteaking and /u/CloudwalkingOwl, it seems that there are some on this sub who are more interested in Taoism as a religion or at least in the case of Mr. Coons, the traditions and practices of Internal Elixer Cultivation.  

To express this, I will be drawing a lot of parallels between Taoist religion and Abrahamic faiths because most people are more familiar with Abrahamic religions and their theology. I find it very useful to do this. Now, on to the info.

**Main text:**

Recently I've been looking into more of the gods expressed in Taoism. One little piece I've fallen quite in love with is the Wufang Shangdi. According to Wikipedia, these gods are actually different manifestations of one supreme God who is the creator deity. One could liken this to Trinitarian ideas in Christianity (i.e The Father, The Son, The Holy Spirit). This segment of the Taoist pantheon is also known as the five interchangeable faces. The interesting thing about these deities is that they are compatible with I Ching expressions of the five elements that are the sources of constant change. This makes sense as they are an expression of the Tao's constantly changing nature. Furthermore, they have cosmological metaphors in constellations. This is very similar to Jewish and Muslim ideas about the heavens. 

The veneration of these gods has a rich and oft confusing history. I find it best to look at the older rituals and rites first because they are the precursor to how these deities came to be worshiped. In the time shortly after the reign of the Yellow Emperor, veneration and sacrifices were carried out to the Highest Deity, often on the sot where he was supposed to have done sacrifices. However, during the Han Dynasty, there was a debate that broke out between Confucians and some proto-Taoists. The Confucians wanted a more centralized worship while proto-Taoists encouraged the worship of local deities in *service* of the highest deity, who they conceptualized as Taiyi. Early Taoists actually conceptualized this deity as being almost synonymous with the Tao, although that is still debated. They also believed that the physical manifestation of this perfection was as the Yellow Emperor. You can look at this also as God/Jesus type theology. The disagreement between this centralized worship of the Supreme Deity and the decentralized worship of Taiyi can be likened to the Protestant or Muslim conception of a supreme God to be worshiped very directly versus the Catholic church's saint worship as a medium by which one gets closer to God. Thereby, we can get closer to the Highest Deity and in practice closer to the purity of the Tao. The Taiyi concept was also later used as an explanation of how Lao Tzu attained his immortality and seat in Heaven (Tian) as the Three Pure Ones. 

Furthermore, the Wufang Shangdi, as manifestations, have servants that act as manifestations of them. I know, very confusing. This was likely caused by incorporation of other gods into the corpus of the Wufnag Shangdi. A notable example is the Dragon King, a subterranean god. This is a mythological symbol of the chaotic nature of the waters, which is why he is conceptualized as a dragon. However, he is also a symbol of the yang generation of power from the yin potential of water. This is powerful and can be associated with Internal Elixir cultivation (paging James Coons). The Dragon God is a servant of the Jade Emperor who is, in turn, the assistant of one of the Three Pure Ones. 

Some questions I have for some people who have more knowledge than me:

Why is the Dragon King a servant of the Jade Emperor? Why is the Jade Emperor venerated above all as opposed to the Highest Deity?

If you've stuck through this long, thank you for reading.  "

taoism,Learn to recite Tao Te Ching with AudioBrain App,"Hi all,

Tao Te Ching, in my view, is one of the most life-affirming and beautiful works of philosophy ever created.

About a year ago I found an app on Google Play called AudioBrain, which helps users learn to recite poems. I started using this app, and was a huge fan of the method, which seemed to help me (and my goldfish memory) remember poems by writers like Shakespeare, Henley, etc..

I eventually got in touch with the creators and we started talking about the possible applications of the AudioBrain memory retention method, and I suggested that they make an app which helps people to remember Tao Te Ching so that they can incorporate Laozi's worldview and use it to meditate and better cope with the enormous stresses of the modern world.

Anyway, I volunteered to be a part of the app, recorded my voice reading a public domain version of Tao Te Ching aloud and now the app is  available on Google Play.

I thought this would be a good place to share it; I'm not here for the purposes of advertising, I just think Taoism is something really worth learning about.

It only came out today, and yet I can already recite the first verse from memory. Let me know how you get on!

The app: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AudioBrain.TaoTeChing&amp;hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AudioBrain.TaoTeChing&amp;hl=en)"
taoism,How to contend with desire without suppressing it?,"Hi all. I've been interested in Taoism for about three years now, but there's always been something I've struggled to understand. In the Tao Te Ching, there is a strong emphasis on defeating desire:

&gt;The way of the Tao is simple--  
&gt;  
&gt;stop striving, defeat desire.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the absence of striving, there is peace;  
&gt;  
&gt;in the absence of desire, there is satisfaction. (Goddard, ch. 37)

Yet, I find there to be a major emphasis on not trying to force yourself to do things and instead embracing what comes naturally. How does one contend with desires like loneliness, hunger, or sleepiness in this way?

My understanding is that one should recognize their existence in consciousness, but not be swayed by them. By merely noticing them is to accept them. This understanding may be more Buddhist in its conception as I generally practice Vipassana meditation. Nonetheless, how does one defeat desire by recognizing it? Furthermore, if one is not to judge thoughts as good or bad, but to merely acknowledge them, how does attempting to defeat desire (and thus, seeing it as something that \*needs\* to be defeated) not make this idea contradictory?

I would guess that my understanding of this is flawed. Can someone explain this more clearly to me? I sometimes have difficulty understanding poetic language."

my mind my heart are too much

i destroy myself each day several times

then i reawaken over and over

i get on the trail but lose it each time

and when i pursue without doubt

i get the trail but must abandon all desire

and i have no knowledge yet i know what to say

i have no desire yet i know what to get

it seems there is no difference between me and the world

but i start doubting because it all seems in union and i destroy myself

no longer i remember but something is lost

i find my way over and over

and each time it is as if it were always so

and i;m just continuing

seamlessly i know what to do as if i am one with the surrouindings

as if my things and society and people are not different from me

as if the observer and observed is caught together inseperably

in a huge sea or web

this time my body got damaged

it seems i am hurried along and my doubt causes friction all over my body

when i am on the trail i act from the heart

getting on the trail i call heartmind to body out of void

a collosal energy emergence and the whole body vibrates

and it heals

there is no choise there;s just a happening

yet i do not feel like i am just happening

i feel like i am not real but so real because i am not real

my mistake is that i advance my mind before something happens

out of confusion i am disturbed

when i lose the trail

i say before saying

i do before doing

i forget the heart

yet i feel i can do anything i only do what i do

doing is heartmind non-doing is void

all my pursuits lead back to the trail

this is the trail

but it is only one way

another way is to have a heart and mind

yet not dedicate it

dedicating it gives peace yet you must do the work of dedication

how can there be peace without dedication?

simply body is burnt but you only feel weak

mind is hypnotized but you think it;s you

creativity emerges out of letting go

it is that letting go of the heartmind aka otherself / other and self

the body or mind is able to get refreshed like a seed in random generator

it is amazing as in the process of relieving the heartmind

one experiences other as self on the left

do you not believe mind goes to mind?

in opting out of the relieving

your mindbody or heartmind tightens again

and starts figuring out how the self is known

and before you know it you;re back in the game"

taoism,New Daoist Hermit post about Confucianism,"I've just published something on my ""Diary of a Daoist Hermit"" blog about Confucianism. Some folks believe that all Daoists view all Confucianism with contempt. This isn't true, so I think that it's useful for people interested in Daoism to understand a bit about Confucious and Mencius, and their ideas. If you choose to reject them, then you know what it is you are rejecting. And if you choose to learn from them, like the lineage that I was initiated into, then you can learn something that other Daoists have found worthwhile. If you like the post, consider supporting it in one way or another.

taoism,A Christian told me meditation is selfish,"Here is his comment.

""Sorry i glided past your response. I sent a video, instead. 

You sound like you have reached some sort of grand cosmic conclusion. But to me, you just sound like you simply seek answers off of your own intuition. Especially the last part you mentioned, the part about taking in doctrines. 

You think this meditation is connecting you to something ""deeper,"" but really you're just delving more and more into yourself; yourself and all your own self interests. 

When you flex that brain 'muscle,' all you're really doing is concentrating hard to distract yourself from everyone and everything. In other words, you purposely trying to not care about others, about their problems, or about problems in general.

You're not being enlightened, you're being selfish. 

Of course, i believe that what you are doing is somewhat consistent, given your worldview. Veiled in a cloak of 'mystic spiritualism,' you are simply ignoring somewhat complicated, yet 'felt' grand moral imperatives of the universe. You are slowly, through meditation, mentally and spiritually trying to erase the grand narrative that sometimes strongly sometimes faintly tug on your soul. 

Thats why you must look within and not without: that is, not outside yourself. You must not look to words - language; because language always represents something else - something outside of us. No, the more you look within yourself, you are only left to literally yourself: physical-ness, and instinct. Again, this is consistent with your worldview. 

But Dakota, dont do it. Dont slowly fall back into yourself, leaving everyone behind. Even if you believe you care about many people, the more you trust this grand mystical consciousness that you feel yourself drawn to, it is inevitable you will leave everyone behind. Thats why Buddhist meditate for so long. They try to reach the end of this world, and even themselves. They simply want to leave without leaving. Thats why they dont commit suicide, they meditate (in that way). They forget about everyone and everything to chase themselves. And even when they reach the point where the whole world is behind them, when they finally only have themselves, they must go further. They must escape even themselves.

Dont fall into that Dakota. Dont find yourself by losing yourself. Find God while he may be found. He gives life and movement to everything. Therefore, he is always near to be found. But you must look away from yourself.""

I've honestly never heard someone criticize meditation before. I understand a spiritual journey does require a degree of selfishness as does all survival. But I also think god/ tao/ logos/ brahmen/ the divine is within all of us. 

The comment about ""especially the last part you mentioned the part about doctrines""was in response to me telling him the difference between shamans and priests. Shamans go into seclusion, priests go to schools and are fed doctrines.

The path of the shaman seems more intuitive to me. Then again I've always fantasized about being a hermit. But it seems if you're going to come into contact with a higher force it would be in this way and not through books. And if he was right about the Christian god why couldn't i hear him in the silence of a mountain?

With all that i do feel there is something he's right about and I didn't like it at first. I'm not really sure what bothered me. That somehow I'm forsaking the world I suppose."
taoism,"How do I avoid being disgusted by human behavior which I perceive as being ""not-Tao""?","See title. 

I know that Taoism encourages us not to make value judgments, and I accept the wisdom of this. At the same time, as I find myself meditating and contemplating the Tao, I find one point to be difficult to resolve - which is how to avoid making value judgments on the concept of Taoism itself, and behavior that seems to me to be - or not to be - in line with Taoist principles. 

That is, I feel that acting in line with Taoist principles is ""a good thing"". Perhaps I am wrong, but isn't this the definition of a Taoist? It is because I believe this that I follow the Tao - or am I wrong?

Either way - when I see human beings consumed by chasing manifestations of their desires and a thousand different petty trinkets, I remain disgusted and find myself wanting to disengage from society. The Tao Te Ching describes this sort of superficial and unwise behavior as being ""Not-Tao"" at one point, and advises that it will ""soon pass"". At the same time, I don't foresee the passing of this sort of behavior within my own lifetime. 

So my question is - How should I feel about this for now? How can I be aware of the misery human beings inflict on themselves by living in a state of ""Not-Tao"" and accept this as part of the Tao? Should I simply plan to go into seclusion, or am I missing something?"
taoism,Is me getting into Taoism cultural appropriation?,"I am not Chinese. I am actually a Hispanic living in Texas. I was raised Catholic but decided to convert due to a large number of reasons. Taoism is the closest to my personal philosophy which has been heavily influenced by the words of Bruce Lee, who I've been a fan of since I was eight. But seeing as how we're in the day and age that we are now where anything can become a controversy, is the fact that I'm adopting a Chinese religion (or philosophy) going to cause problems because I'm not Chinese? Last month a bunch of people went nuts because a white girl wore a Chinese dress to prom. My friend gave me one of those jackets with the button knots but I've never worn it in public (also it's one size too small but I've never had the heart to tell him)."
taoism,The problem of evil,"How does tao and eastern spirituality in general deal with the problem of evil? I mean hurricane victims, 3rd world children with aids, crack babies, etc.

I understand that you can't have good without bad any more than you can have a front without a back but that implies its 50-50 when the ratio of good to bad seems more like 90-10. Even more so when you think about the lives of wild animals or factory farm animals.

I practice Qigong since I saw it for the first time (I'm bipolar, and the breath and meditation help me control it and It's being over a year and a half since my last crises). I believed that you have a power over yourself and you can improve. And that balance is the most important thing to evolve/improve (downfalls, fails, and deceptions are as important as the good stuff).

Lao Tsu (Tao Te Ching), Benjamin Hoff (The Tao of Pooh), and few others are the texts that I already read. Besides posts and pages on web

Is this the way of Tao? or am I just mislead to think it? Can I be a Deist/Taoist?

taoism,Purpose and the Tao,"Where is the balance between purpose and purposelessness? 
I have read and interpreted much of the Tao as being about going with the flow and not forcing. But where is the line that defines the sense of drifting pointlessness that I sometimes feel from the drive and purpose that has been drilled to the point of toxicity?

I guess i am struggling to find where Taoism supports motivation and passion for life, without devolving into letting go and floating by with absolute passivity. Somehow that doesn’t feel right to me. 

Thought?"
taoism,"learning to read &amp; move with the elements, seeking teacher","hi - i created a new account to pose this question, as it's an inquiry very close to my heart.

basically: i want to learn to read and move with the elements (air, water, fire, etc., depending on the system one adheres to). I've been practicing a form of outdoor meditative movement improv for the past \~8 years, learning to tune into places, and over time this approach has definitely helped me develop a more acute awareness of the dynamic flows of wind and water -- by paying attention to what I'm feeling inside as I try to tune in, I've become more attuned to subtle changes, kind of thing, and occasionally even able to anticipate them. (yay neuroplasticity!)

what i really want to do is ""become one"" with the elements - learn to tune into them so adeptly that I can glean information through this connection. The best example of what I mean is from the book Original Wisdom by Robert Wolff. He describes witnessing a member of the Sng'oi people of Malayasia describe the depths of the ocean to his community in incredible detail after sitting by the edge of the water in meditation -- it was the first time he had ever been to the ocean. (!)

Why I want to learn this: I believe climate change is real and that weather systems will become increasingly unpredictable over the next 10-20-50 years. If we can learn to read weather systems, ecosystems, and bodies of water with that kind of sensitivity, perhaps we might be better able to understand what humans could do / stop doing, etc. that serves the particular well-being of that system. Plus of course there's the beauty and magic of experiencing the elements on that level.

**My question:** are there teachers out there that I can learn this from? I know it's only possible to get so far without a teacher's guidance into the deeper layers of a practice. Here are some qualities of the teacher I'm hoping to find...

1) Is a person of integrity (has wisdom, demonstrates compassion, is not overly focused on money, fame, adoration, does not sleep with his/her students,  etc.)

2) Has juju and knows how to manage it adeptly and safely (by juju I mean chi/xi, life force energy, etc.) and can teach students how to do this

3) (Ideally) is part of a recognized lineage

4) Teaches both somatic and inner-psyche aspects of practice

**Am I over-romanticizing taoism?** Possibly. I will freely admit that I have Luke-meets-Obi-Wan fantasies. But I also believe true teachers are out there...

Hopefully the above makes sense. If there's anything I can clarify please let me know and I'll do my best.

Thanks in advance for any replies, constructive criticism, helpful advice.....

**Also,** if anyone on here has pursued this kind of practice I would be deeply grateful to hear about your experience....."

taoism,motion of the tao,"what does it mean that ""returning is the motion of the tao?""

and how does one carry out this motion? what does one return to?

is it a motion of the body?

does it start at the mind and then the body follows?

is it equivalent to creating a microcosm?

where each organism is at the center of their own universe?

i;m kind of curious.

it is like lao tzu didn;t learn anything by trying,

he merely tapped into this motion and created his microcosm,

and by this it came natural to him what he did,

and therefore had the ""flow of the tao"" the energy at his disposal.

everything comes out of nothing,

""your body is not your own"".

can it be that carrying out this motion puts you as a child of the tao,

directly out of the source of creation out of emptiness?

there is no difference between the observer and the observed?

can it be that in creating a microcosm it must be a mutual relationship between the observer and the observed?

all things come to he who embrace the one?

is it because the usual human or animal are not in grasp of what is the ""mystery of mysteries?"" and thus see somebody who has embraced the one as a gate or at least a hint to/of the mystery of mysteries?

if we are all each one the god of the universe,

then each one must have this power, and because we are

each one the god of the universe and one is acting out of the emptiness

at the source of creation, then all things can trust him or her or it,

because really he is you, literally, but you are also him.

can it be that in carrying out the motion of the tao,

that you must be without preference, or rather that doing it

taoism,"Taosim and other traditions (Buddhism, Yoga etc)","Hello everyone.

After a couple years of experimenting with various spiritual teachings (Buddhism, Yoga, A Course in Miracles to name a few) I recently found Taosim and I'm immediately more drawn to this philosophy than anything I've come across before - except possibly Ashtanga Yoga, but even some of that I'm like ''hmm, yeah, not sure about this part''. 

However with Taoism, everything I've learned I seem to agree with. It all just seems to make sense and supports my own beliefs of how and what life is. It appears to approach life from a different angle compared to other teachings, with less metaphysical (EDIT: this should read 'supernatural' or something similar) but more practical concepts?

Did anyone else feel this way after discovering Daosim?

4. If you loose it you are inevitably disordered;

5. If you attain it you are inevitably well ordered.

6. Diligently clean out its lodging place

7. And its vital essence will naturally arrive.

8. Still your attempts to imagine and conceive of it.

9. Relax your efforts to reflect on and control it.

10. Be reverent and diligent

11. And its vital essence will naturally stabilize.

12. Grasp it and don't let go

13. Then the eyes and ears won't overflow

14. And the mind will have nothing else to seek.

15. When a properly aligned mind resides within you,

16. The myriad things will be seen in their proper perspective.

----

I think there's a natural tension in a lot of eastern systems of self-cultivation, or at least a perceived tension from the western perspective. At the very least, I know a few people who have been caught up on the issue of how to be diligent about letting things take their natural course, or how to grasp on to a system that teaches you to let go. I always come back to the phrase from the Daodejing, ""Strive for the effortless"". Weiwuwei is attaining an unconscious mastery over a craft or technique, but you don't practice a technique by doing nothing. Attaining that level of mastery over the Dao, however? Well, we all know the first line of Laozi's book. Anyway, the passage above I think conveys it nicely -- the vital essence arrives naturally, the noumenon resides naturally within, etc.; but also, there is the admonition to be reverent and diligent. 

For some background, the Nei Yeh is an instruction manual for practitioners of Daoist breath meditation. What techniques or insights can you share about how to diligently let things take their course while practicing, or just in daily life? 

For my part, I think a mantra is invaluable, especially if you have a mind that likes to run in vicious circles."

taoism,"The School of ""Pure Conversation""","&gt; The term *ch'ing 'tan*, or ""pure conversation"", implies philosophy for its own sake. It was ""pure"" in the same sense that certain government offices were called ""pure"" towards the end of the Han dynasty, when Confucian scholars formed a faction opposed to corruption and even to jobs involving the opportunity for corruption. The *ch'ing t'an* for Taoists, on somewhat different grounds than these Confucians, also turned their backs on impurity, that is, on worldly advantage.
&gt; 
&gt; Some members of the school were scholars. Wang Pi (225-249 CE) who is usually considered with Ho Yen to be its founder, wrote commentaries on the Book of Changes and the Tao Te Ching. Hsiang Hsiu (221-ca 300), wrote commentary on the Chuang Tzu which we have, somewhat expanded, over the signature of Kuo Hsiang. Chi K'ang (232-262) was both a scholar and a poet: he wrote essays on the lute and on ""life-nurture"".
&gt; 
&gt; Wang Pi, Hsiang Hsiu and Kuo Hsiang maintained the curious thesis that Confucius was a greater Taoist than Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu. While these two had merely talked about Non-Being, Confucius had reached it - which was why he never talked about it, just as he never talked about eliminating desire because in his own spiritual development he had even eliminated the desire to eliminate desire. Wang, Hsiang, and Kuo amplified on the old Taoist themes of following nature, determinism, and relativity. But they attacked the idea of the Sage as a hermit. Fung Yu-lan believes that they wished to make Taoism into a philosophy better adapted to participants in worldly life. And, in fact, some of them did enter government service. They seem to represent a more purely philosophical, more Confucian wing of the *ch'ing 'tan* school.
&gt; 
&gt; Other members of the school refused office. They seem to represent a more Taoist, more lyrical wing. Their lyricism is often termed feng liu (""wandering from convention""). Feng liu is best exemplified in the activities of a group known as the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove. Not far from Chi K'ang's luxurious estate in Honan was a grove of bamboo where he and certain Taoist friends used to walk in the heat of the afternoon, making up poetry, drinking a little wine, and playing the lute. Here, too, they indulged themselves in ""pure conversation"" which would end, as Fung Yu-lan puts it, when they reached the Unnameable and then ""Stopped talking and silently understood each other with a smile."" Their strolls invariably wound up at the local tavern. There they would turn to serious drinking. By the end of the evening they would be in a stupor of glorious indifference to the world and intimacy with the Tao. ...
&gt; 
&gt; Two of the Sages, for example, were Juan Chi (210-263) and his nephew Juan Hsien. Like Chi K'ang, they were poets and accomplished musicians. They were also devoted to the bottle. Indeed, Juan Chi scandalized the Confucians by drinking heavily through his mother's mourning. Since the Juans considered cup an unnatural sophistication, they used to set a monstrous bowl of wine on the ground and sit around it sipping its contents directly. Sometimes the pigs trotted over for a taste. No matter! There was room for all to drink together. 
&gt; 
&gt; The most celebrated drinker among the Seven Sages was Liu Ling (221-300). His eulogy of wine is still preserved. He used to have a servant follow him about with a flask in one hand and a shovel in the other - the first in case he wanted a drink, the second for digging his grave wherever he fell. Liu Ling is also the person who liked to go about his house naked. Once he was interrupted by some stuffy Confucian visitors. They expressed surprise at the absence of trousers. Liu replied: ""The whole universe is my house and this room is my trousers. What are you doing here inside my trousers?""

taoism,"Fortune telling, consequences and scapegoating","I do not know anything about Taoism / Daoism, this is a quest for knowledge. It is also my first reddit post.

My student, a smart and beautiful 20-something Asian woman, has been a bit depressed this semester. After enquiry, and a bit of coaxing, she confided that she has been experiencing a string of bad luck, and not for the first time, so she has accepted her fate. Upon enquiry on said fate, she indicated that her father used to be a Taoist fortune teller, who made brisk business, but each successful assignment though lucrative, always resulted in extreme family hardship. Apparently the bad luck only stopped when she was born, and designated as the family scapegoat, in a manner of speaking. From the looks of it she is the most capable of the lot.

My qestions:
1. Does fortune telling earn the teller bad luck?
2. Does the idea of scapegoating exist in Taoism?
2.1. If it does, does scapegoating cleanse such bad luck? 
2.2. If so, is there a way for the scapegoat to cleanse themselves (bearing in mind the scapegoat has absolved her parents of any responsibility, or foreseen no likelihood of assistance in that regard)?"
taoism,Having trouble with these adjustments in my life.,"So, I'm struggling to find my way with the Tao in the modern N. American lifestyle that surrounds me. 

How do some of you let go of junk? Not emotional junk, but the piles of stuff that we surround ourselves with and try to impress one another? I do have attachment to things such as my collections and toys from when I was a kid that are still lost up in the attic. But I'm not sure if I should let go of these things to allow myself to move forward and grow. It sort of feels like I want to hoard it to make myself feel better. Maybe due to low self esteem? Is it fine to collect things or will they just slow me down in the end?

Desire vs. Greed: Consumerism is rampant no matter where you live nowadays. How do some of you control yourself and realise true desire vs. plain greed? For example, I have a car, it's a huge PoS. It works fine and I upkeep it, but I want a newer vehicle so that I feel good just cruising around  \(I have agoraphobia so it's a bit of a carrot on a stick thing too. I could drive it around to get out of the house.\) I appreciate the car, as I should being a Taoist, but I also desire the comfort of a newer vehicle to allow myself to adventure farther out of my bubble; as well, not having to smash the tape deck whenever the converter starts to go on the fritz while I'm trying to listen to tunes because THE STUPID THING IS SO OLD! ... Is this just greed? When can a desire be fulfilled without it being a front for greed to slip in?

taoism,It's really bizarre that my life can be represented by the spinning Yin-Yang symbol...,"Hi from Spain,

I mean, maybe I'm biased but it looks pretty accurate. There are cycles of light and darkness and, at the peak of each one, there's a dot of the opposite side: when I was at the peak of the light cycle (my first love/relationship/sex), there was a really bad thing called betrayal, but it keep it high for a while; and when I was at the peak of the dark cycle I almost killed myself but after a month or so, a white dot called falling in love again with somebody amazing appeared (then darkness again). 

It's really interesting, but since it's hard to contrast and measure it in a scientific way, let's say there's something genuine about it. We are like a phoenix, we die and reborn and that's why the Jesus story was so popular for so long...

taoism,TTC Chapter 2 and Plato's Cyclical Argument,"## TTC Chapter 2 and Plato's Cyclical Argument

Plato's Cyclical Argument appears in Phaedo. The insight is a thread that runs through all of western philosophy. It's cool to compare it to the second chapter of the TTC. Plato is arguing for immortality, but if we put aside the conclusion and just look at the bones of the argument, it's this \(from the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Phaedo\):

1. All things come to be from their opposite states: for example, something that comes to be “larger” must necessarily have been “smaller” before \(70e\-71a\).
2. Between every pair of opposite states there are two opposite processes: for example, between the pair “smaller” and “larger” there are the processes “increase” and “decrease” \(71b\).
3. If the two opposite processes did not balance each other out, everything would eventually be in the same state: for example, if increase did not balance out decrease, everything would keep becoming smaller and smaller \(72b\).

4.  Since “being alive” and “being dead” are opposite states, and “dying” and “coming\-to\-life” are the two opposite processes between these states, coming\-to\-life must balance out dying \(71c\-e\).

And part of TTC chapter 2: \(Mitchell translation\)

When people see some things as beautiful,

other things become ugly

When people see some tings as good,

other things become bad.

Being and non\-being create each other.

Difficult and easy support each other.

High and low depend on each other.

Before and after follow each other.

...

It's a similar point that's being made."
taoism,Discord,Is there any discords specifically for Taoism?
taoism,What is the taoist interpretation of integrity and how much weight is on it.,"I come to taoism by way of recovering from a fundamentalist religious cult.  In order to guard myself from falling for another set of principles meant to manipulate, I decided that a worldview whose most popular text asserts ""the way that can be described is not the true way"" is probably a good belief to protect people from spiritual manipulation.

As I've been unpacking my experience and the beliefs I used to hold and exchanging them for more open and healthy ones from Taoism and other beliefs, I have somewhat stumbled across an ideal that I'm holding onto very strongly. That being: any time you promise something... you do it... regardless of what it is or what comes up.

I continued to embrace this ideal because it was forcing me to think very critically and be very aware of the promises I made which I think is a very healthy thing... but I'm not so sure that this is always healthy in practice.  For example, several people who know me very well have taken the knowledge that I always keep my promises and used that to manipulate me into acting against my own best interest by altering the situation under which the promise was made and then reminding me of this ideal I hold... without realizing it I continued with my end of the bargain and ended up used but at least my integrity is intact.  Other examples are promises I made in previous relationships that I still hold (for example: I promised an ex that I wouldn't see a certain movie without her.  We broke up before it came out and I still have never seen the movie because I'm still going to keep my promise to her.  It's not a hugely important issue on the surface but there are similar ways I am holding myself back because of promises I made to people no longer in my life and that feels romantic but also kind of extreme.)

I'll continue to follow where the path leads but along the way I wanted to ask the community if there are any good passages or writings to study about the taoist viewpoint on this kind of radical integrity, integrity in general, or if there is examples of breaking oaths and backing out of promises lining up with the tao.

Thanks all you sagely folks!"
taoism,What is the relationship between discipline and effortlessness (or wu-wei?),"I posted this over at /r/zen and apparently they really don't like talking about wu-wei, or Taoism! I always thought that Zen and Chan grew out of Taoism. Anyway, here's what I posted, maybe you can help me out with this. And I know you guys aren't crazy about using words like ""ego"" but I made some substitutions for you. 

&gt;I've been messing around with a bunch of Shambhala guys (Vajrayana, Chogyam Rinpoche's people). They have a relationship to discipline that I have mixed feelings about, and I don't have a doubt about their commitment to non-dual thinking. They present an image that discipline isn't a term loaded with negativity, it's just another word for barriers, and those are just a part of life. Plants need cell walls. We need skin or our organs would fall out. And so they say that you're either gonna get disciplined by your ~~ego~~ need to control things and build walls around it or you gotta discipline your ~~ego~~ need to control things. You gotta create a routine to lose yourself.

&gt; And it's a compelling case, if life's been very hard and you've been finding yourself clinging to everything that passes by, and to avoid the ambiguity and pain of it all you spend days on the internet pissing your time away. I've been on a discipline kick for about a month or two now, when it comes to meditation but also when it comes to everything. I turned my whole life into a to do list and I scheduled out every minute of my day. I feel like that discipline is slipping. I'm beating myself up for what I don't get done. I'm confused because a lot of the things that are on that to do list, like working out or cleaning up my room or meditating every day are good things, but why do they made me feel like shit though?

&gt; What's a ~~Zen~~ Taoist approach to discipline? I really liked the idea of wu-wei and effortlessness. Maybe I'm misreading my Shambhala guys, but this seems like a helluva lot of effort. (Plus they're kinda conservative. Much more buttoned up and, well, disciplined than my favorite Zen maniacs.)"

taoism,The importance of lineages.,"I think that when people talk about ""Daoism"" in places like this it is important to avoid making universal, declarative statements such as ""Daoism teaches"" or ""in Daoism we do such and such"". The reason why is because Daoism is a very large tradition that encompasses a great many different points of view, schools, and, lineages. Unfortunately, it is also more than a little esoteric, which means that a significant fraction of practitioners in one school don't have any experience at all in another.   


Just to give you a flavour of how paradoxical all of this can be for the naive, consider the following issues:

* philosophical versus religious 
* meat eating versus vegetarian schools
* celibate versus married Daoshis
* where do hermits fit in?
* what about the 19th century movement to create a ""social Daoism""?
* Is taijiquan a martial art? Qigong? Neidan? All three at the same time?
* What exactly is the difference between qigong and neidan, anyway?
* is holding onto the One meditation? how about chanting? walking meditation? sungazing? or any of the myriad of other forms of activity? 
* is ritual a form of meditation? or is it a superstition? 
* what exactly is qi?
* are ""the three treasures"" qi, jing, and, shen? or are they humility, frugality, and, compassion?
* what texts are key to Daoism? The ***Laozi***, ***Taiping Jing***, the ***Nei\- yeh***, ***Zhuangzi***, and, ***Liezi***? Or are they more esoteric texts like the ***Secret of the Golden Flower***? 

I could go on and on. But the main thing to understand is that each particular practitioner of Daoism\-\-\-over the centuries\-\-\-has come to their own particular decision about all of these issues. And then they have passed on these decisions in what they chose to teach anyone who came to them for advice. These disciples then went on to do the same thing. As a result, there is a very complex Daoist ""ecosystem"" that has arise.   


There has been no centralized authority that has exerted any sort of ""quality control"" over this complex mass of ideas. As a result there are a lot of different lineages that have come about that don't really believe in exactly the same thing. It's important, therefore, to remember that no matter what you have been taught by any particular teacher that that may only be the teaching of one particular lineage, a group of lineages, or,\-\-\-at the very least\-\-\-not universally believed by everyone that could be called a Daoist. I would suggest, therefore, that people begin all conversations about Daoism by embracing the ideal of ""humility"". And the best way for us to do that would be to try to avoid statements that imply or identify something as ""the true teaching"" as opposed to something else.

Recently I posted some Taoism based advice on a comment and it seemed to help but I was hoping someone could tell me if it was right. And if I am wrong is there a name for what I'm talking about?

Ok, the way I see life is like one of those lazy rivers in water parks. If you kick back and relax then the lazy river of life will get you where you need to be but if you swim against it, eventually you'll get tired and washed away. Except I imagine it in a huge Grand Canyon esque place that doesn't loop in a circle, has no clear end, and call it the Lazy River of Life. 

You've got to trust that where the LRoL takes you is going to be good. The best way I can describe it is by doing what makes yourself and people around you happier. But always do what's true to you, if it makes you feel bad then it's bad for you and you shouldn't do it. 

I can only speak for me but I've found to be kind, care, enjoy nature, and having patience are key things there. Once I started doing things like that I started feeling better about life and myself. Don't get me wrong, it's hard. I work in retail so that's hard, and of course...the news in general. But those moments of real calm when I'm at peace with everything are worth it. 

It doesn't stop you from having control of your life as you might think. Again, in my experience, I had a plan of where I wanted to be in 20 years (long story short it involves buying land and building my own house) after getting into Taoism I realised I can cut that plan down to about 10 years, five if I push it. 

Now, I'm not saying the LRoL is a wish granting genie. But because I'm doing things that are making me feel better as a person it's giving me more motivation to do the things I love. I've learned to play to my strengths and accept my weaknesses. By being happier in myself it's given me the ability to take positive steps in my life. 

Going back to the lazy river analogy for a second. If you imagine a massive lazy river that splits into 3 separate roads. One of them is the route you want to go down and some people (by virtue of how they landed in the river) go down it automatically. You can go down it too, but it has to be the river you want to go down. Not the one you think you should go down. 

The trick is finding the one you want to go down after spending all your life being told by outside influences which one you should go down. Meditation helps for that, but that will depend on you. Once you know it you'll know it. And I think that's why people say they can't show you the way. When you get it, you get it. But you can't explain it well. 

Now, I know life isn't that simple. I know not everyone has been in lucky in life as I've been. I'm not rich (like I said, I work retail) but I earn enough money to live comfortably and that puts me over a lot of the world's population. So I do know that how I see things is probably not the way that will work for everyone. But I figured even if only 0.5% of the global population is like me, then that still means there's  35,000,000 people like me who it might help too. "

That means that they are in the process of erasing themselves potentially so that we don't create them at such a high price to ourselves.

taoism,The Way of Freedom,"I find writing almost therapeutic, so let me share with you the discoveries I've made since my last post, ""Magnum Opus"".

~~~

Let me also add, Evernote is a great journaling tool, as well as a nice tool to write with in general. I highly recommend picking up a copy of the program, it's free after all. I think the importance of writing is very understated in today's time. Journaling your feelings, your discoveries of the day, your experiences, these things are very important. Often times, discoveries come in the shape of one singular moment. It's up to you if you make the best of that moment. I'll say that every experience is a necessary experience, and it's up to you if you learn from the lessons of life.

~~~

Once you come to the ultimate realization of life, there are two roads you can go down. You can let the truth break you, or you can become stronger and persist. My brother and me are very different people, but we have one thing in common. We have a certain gift. I don't know what to call it, but I can say that we have the ability to see things for what they truly are. Building off of that, the ""truth"" is one thing. It's up to you however how you view that one thing. If you notice the emptiness of life, you can let it break you, as it broke my brother. He's fallen into a pit of Nihilism, to say the least. He learned the truth a long time ago, but there's a key difference. It made him give up. He learned the truth, and he chose to only view it in one certain light. When learning the truth, being open to the many facets of the truth is very important. My brother chose to only see the negativity, and it destroyed him. He gave up. He spiraled into a life of narcissism, drugs, not caring in general. He let his greed overcome him and destroy him. Instead of using the truth to grow, he chose to embrace it in a negative way and consume him. I think it's very easy to let the negativity of the truth consume you. Instead of becoming selfless, he decided on selfishness. Let me take advantage of life and make the most of it, he said. So, he fell into the pit of nihilism, and let the cycle of suffering consume him. Instead of trying to free himself of the fetters of life, he gave up. Ie spiraling into the selfish life that now consumes him; drugs, women, chasing his pleasure and forsaking anything that would get in the way, thinking of only himself, seeking to exploit life. So, as we've seen, the ""truth"" is is a universal truth. It's the personal way someone views the truth, that makes it true. It's very easy to dwell on one facet of the truth, that's one thing I've noticed a lot of people struggle with. Keep your mind open to all possibilities. So, I propose a new way. A new way, which also incorporates the wisdom of old. I'll call it, ""The Path of Freedom""

~~~

**The Path of Freedom**

If we take a look at Buddhism, we can clearly see that it is not ""the middle way"". Buddhism, like all other popular philosophy, focuses only on ONE facet of the truth. So, this Path of Freedom will be the real ""middle way"". Think of my brother as an example, his way is only one extreme view of the ""truth"". I think that any philosophy promoting total compassion and selflessness is just another extreme view of the ""truth"". Furthermore, any philosophy or religion promoting one specific way can't possibly capture the total truth. Because the true truth is personal. Just because emptiness may possibly be a universal truth, that doesn't mean you need to dwell in either living to serve yourself, or living to serve others. This Path of Freedom I propose is going to be very different from most popular philosophy. One main component of this path I propose is keeping in mind ALL facets of the truth, life itself. Incorporating ALL the paths into one singular path, ""the middle way"".

~~~

Clear your mind and dwell only in the present moment; the past is gone, the future has yet to come. You live only now. One second in the past, one second in the future, these things are irrelevant. You should be focusing your energy on the one thing you can actually control, the present moment. Let's think about this subject: Nietzsche said ""God is dead"" ~~ Those 3 words undoubtedly changed my life. Don't live life for anyone but yourself. Don't do what you do because society tells you to, because you're trying to fit into a mold, because you're living only for some ""higher power"", don't live to please others, don't live any one way because you think you have to. Do what you do because it's YOUR choice. Everything you do in life is a CHOICE. It's also YOUR choice if you decide that you can't live life for yourself. That's the point of Nietzsche's statement. Your life is YOUR life. What you decide to do is completely up to YOU. Only YOU are responsible for living your life, so stop living it for the sake of other things, live it for YOU. Live life as you will because it's YOUR choice to live life the way you choose to live it. If you're the type of person that's kind and compassionate, if you're a truly selfless person, do it because it's fulfilling to YOU. Don't do it because you're trying to please others, don't do it because you're following some philosophy or set path that someone else thought up, do it because it's what YOU want to do. When you make the conscious decision to say ""I'm going to behave like this and do this"" you unknowingly ensnare yourself, because it was YOUR choice to make that decision. If an opportunity comes up where you can express your kindness and selflessness, do it because you want to, if you want to, not because you feel like you have to. Like I said, you dwell only in the current moment, and it's up to you, and only you, what you decide to do in that moment. I'll be honest, I don't know if any higher powers exist. One thing I do believe in though, is that even if they would have an existence, they would be completely unconcerned with our existence. Unless of course, them interacting with you would somehow benefit them. Your life is 100% your choice, so why live it a certain way because you think that's what someone else wants? Does 99% of humans pay an ant any mind? A human might kill an ant if it seems to be a pest, outside of that, the ant is the least of our concerns on a daily basis. Maybe some would study the ant and their behavior, but no human would spend their entire life trying to cater to those ants. Following that train of thought, use some common sense. If there is a higher power, do you REALLY think that a higher power would expend energy trying to make our lives better? Do you really think that higher power would have any concern for us at all? A higher power undoubtedly has higher things to worry about, just the same way us humans have better things to worry about than ants. So, don't get caught in the ensnarement of trying to please higher powers. Don't let your life revolve around trying to live a certain way you think will appease the possible higher powers. Even if you would act a way or live a life that would be 100% in tune with them, you'd still be the least of their concerns. All religion and philosophy is MAN MADE. Live for yourself, and stop trying to appease society, stop trying to appease other people, stop trying to appease higher powers. If you live for others, you might as well not live. It's YOUR life. Even if you are the most humble and selfless person, do you think anyone would care? You may get your name in a textbook, but you will be forgotten. This is why I say, live for yourself. If it's your true nature to be totally compassionate, selfless, and kind, do it because it is fulfilling to you, not because you think you have to, not because you seek recognition, not because you wish to inflate your ego. Like I said, everything in life is a choice. How you live life is a choice, what you believe in is a choice. Stop the foolish train of thought believing that there's anything but you responsible for your life besides yourself. Let's now get back on the topic of dwelling only in the current moment. You can only influence the current moment. While the current moment may affect future events, don't base your actions on such a principle. Do what you want to, because you want to. Life is what YOU make it. If you want to live in a hellish nihilistic pit like my brother, or a brainwashed selfless life like monks, keep in mind that it was YOUR choice, and it will always be YOUR choice. Instead of crying to some higher power to save you from your sorrow and situation for example, realize that YOU are the one dwelling on such things, YOU are the one ultimately choosing to live that life, and there's nothing besides YOU that can save YOURSELF. Only YOU are responsible for the current moment in the life you live, because it's YOUR life. This is by far the most important piece of knowledge I have ever incorporated into my life. If you can follow this train of thought of living your own life for your own reasons, the way you want to live it, you will see you have the ability to do anything you want to do, because once again, it's YOUR choice to choose what you want to do.

~~~

So, to summarize, live your own life, for your own reasons, the way you want to live it. It's your life; if you can understand that and take control and realize it's your life, you can do anything you want to do. It's your choice, after all.

~~~

Another thing I'd like to discuss is the ""universal truth of emptiness"". I'm not going to write a massive essay about this topic, but keep in mind, life is empty only if you let it be empty. Once you can master the principle of controlling your own life and your own destiny, you can decide such a thing for yourself.

~~~

I will say however that suffering is most definitely a universal truth. If you desire something, the opposite of that will undoubtedly bring you suffering, only if you let it though. Keeping in mind my earlier train of thought, it's your choice if you dwell on one thing and choose to let it defeat you.
So, I have some advice for you. Let go of expectations, and you won't be hurt when the things you want fail to come. By living only in the moment and becoming unfocused on the past or future, you eliminate a lot of suffering. If something good happens to you, great. If something bad happens to you, so what? So is life. All things in this world are temporary. Keeping in mind that any hardship is temporary, why dwell on it and let it defeat you? It is a choice, after all. The Daodejing says knowing what is sufficient is eternal sufficiency. It's very easy to think that everything is going wrong, letting nihilism and depression defeat you. Once again, it's a choice. If you think of every singular moment as a learning experience, and take to heart the honest and brutal nature of life, learning and growing, you will do yourself a lot of good. Depression and sorrow can lead to great happiness and joy, if you let it. In those toughest moments, be thankful for what you have. And even if you think you have nothing to be thankful for, be thankful to be alive. Imagine all the restless souls that somehow exist. While we may not understand it, they do exist somehow. There are also very evil spirits out there. Why do you think they're so evil? They let life defeat them. They let the hardships of life twist them, so deep. They focused on the negativity to such a point where they couldn't have peace even after death. Do you want to be like that? I can only imagine what these spirits would give just to live again, and have the chance to do it all over. I can only imagine what these spirits would do to escape the suffering. Like I said, your life is your choice. Even if you have nothing to be thankful for, be thankful to be alive. Things can ALWAYS be worse, after all. Knowing what is sufficient will bring you much peace.

~~~

I know I've said it already many times, but by dwelling only in the current moment, you can truly learn to master the self. If you realize you are the only one that controls your own life, and you start living for yourself, you can truly do anything you want to do. I mean, think about it. If you live in the moment, you literally have the choice to do anything you want in that moment.

~~~

That also brings me to my next point, the relationship between desire and suffering. I don't think it's wrong to have desire. If you're a nymphomaniac and you love sex, fuck all the time if you wish. If you love vaping, vape. If you love weed, smoke. It's your choice to do what you wish to do. Every action has consequences though, even if the consequences are unknown, keep that in mind. That's where self control comes into play. It's easy to focus on one specific thing and almost have your life revolve around it, that type of single pointed focus can be very dangerous, though. If you learn to stop having expectations, you won't be hurt when something you expect to happen doesn't happen. If you embrace the unknown, if you embrace change, you can truly find peace. Once again, I don't think it's wrong to desire having certain things in your life, but self control and modesty are very important traits that people need to learn to foster. The Daodejing also says, ""The Sage gives and takes"". This phrase has also brought me a lot of peace. If you expect nothing, when something does happen, it comes as a pleasant surprise. If you can learn to not dwell on things, you will have such peace. It's not easy to do, I'll admit that. But, this is the true way to ending the cycle of suffering. I think the idea of giving up pleasures of life is what a brainwashed fool would say. I think someone would say that only if they have no ability to transcend hardship, and learn self control. Why give up the pleasures of life? Why? All you have to do is choose to become somewhat unaffected by the displeasures of life. While you may never truly be able to become unaffected, you can find peace in the storm. How? Feel the unsatisfaction, but don't dwell on it. Any one state is just a passing state, after all. So, let it pass. The more energy you put into something, the more it manifests. It's very hard to describe this level of self control, but I think it breaks down into just a few easy topics. While annoyances may annoy you, learning to let the annoyance pass you, learning to not let it effect you more than it has to, that's very important. It is your choice, after all, if you choose to dwell on something. So, expect nothing. When you expect nothing, if something happens, you'll be pleasantly surprised. If nothing happens, so what? Nothing is what you expected. Do you know why all things in life are temporary? Why change is an universal truth? Because the present moment is the only moment. I actually have a theory. Maybe there is no past or future. I think the passing of time is actually a human invention. Think of the present moment like RAM for a computer. When humans document the present moment, it doesn't become the past with the passing of more moments. It's still there, it's just no longer pertinent to the current moment. It's not something that's actively happening at the moment. Life is just a series of events that are completely reactive based on the eye of the beholder, that's what I think. So, maybe previous moments can be labeled as the ""past"", but maybe thinking of time chronologically may not actually be the best way to do it. After all, anything could happen at any given moment. Okay, enough of that. Back to the topic at hand, if we can live to dwell only in the current moment, we can learn to control the current moment. We can do what we want to do because we want to do it. We can also make the choice to become unaffected by the things we think of as annoyances or displeasures. If we can truly stay in the moment, annoyances or displeasures would only last for that moment. Is it not the human choice to dwell on something we view as an annoyance or displeasure and let it affect us? Because that one moment the displeasure or annoyance existed in, has already passed. Combining that train of thought of flowing with change, flowing with the moment, with the lack of expectations, could we not find total serenity? Keep in mind, annoyances or displeasures are only annoyances or displeasures because we make the choice to view certain things as annoyances or displeasures. If we can make the choice to not see them like that, we can easily let them pass us by, unaffected. If we can start viewing everything that happens as just something that happens, we can stop running or chasing the things that happen. I say, just let the things that happen happen.  If you can learn to dwell in the present moment, you can learn to become unaffected by the future or past. It's a choice, after all.

~~~

Become somewhat unaffected by the fetters of life; enjoy them, but don't let them enslave you. What do I mean? Instead of taking the Buddhist extreme of going against human nature and seeking to ""eliminate desire to eliminate suffering"", embrace happiness, embrace suffering. What reason is there to try to ""end the cycle""? The cycle truly ends once your higher consciousness stops dwelling on the many ensnarements of life. This is the true ""middle way"". If you think about it, there's no reason to do literally anything, whatever happens happens. You can only control your part in what happens, remember that clearly, and stop trying to control what you can't control. Wu-wei is something very hard to describe. What is wu-wei to me? Wu-wei is flowing with life, open to all possibilities, not running towards or away from whatever life gives you. Just realizing your part in the greater picture, and embracing your role in it. Do what you will, it's your choice. Just stop running towards or away from things you can't control. If you can learn to master the self, you can learn to master your own life. It's your life, after all. If you can become an expert at your role in your life, you will find the ultimate of fulfillment and peace.

~~~

So, I'm going to lay out what I think to be the steps to mastering the self. I'm going to try to write everything I think that's important, but there may be stuff I forgot &amp; left out on accident. I think I pretty much covered it all, though. Think for yourself, it is your life after all. This is only advice I'm giving to you because it works for me.

taoism,Taoism by analogy of chemical catalyst,"I teach high school chemistry and reviewing for final exams lately has me thinking about some parallels that some of you may find interesting. Some quick background \- in a chemical reaction, you begin with reactants that possess a certain amount of energy, and after the completion of the reaction you now have products that possess a certain amount of energy. The difference in energy tells you the nature of the reaction \(it either gives off or releases energy\). But, in either case the reactants need to become 'activated' in order to actually break their bonds and form the products, which means they need to gain some energy to get started. Simply put, a chemical catalyst allows for a different way for reactants to become products that requires less energy to 'activate' the reaction. 

So, my analogy is that in working in accordance to the Tao you are operating in many ways as a catalyst. A recurring theme in Taoism is to 'do your work, then step back.' A catalyst literally does this by facilitating chemical reactions without being used up itself. In our work, I think we should consider the prospect of adding to the world without using ourselves up. Obviously, this is not possible in all types of work for all types of people, which is why it is important to consider our nature. A specific chemical catalyst is only effective for certain reactions, just as we will only work in accordance with the Tao in roles that are natural to us. In chemistry, a substance that works against a reaction and actually makes it require more energy to activate is called an inhibitor. In choosing our work and interactions I think we should strive to catalyze instead of inhibit, but often people work against their nature, trying to fit square pegs into round holes because they feel they obligated for any number of reasons.

Another parallel I find interesting is the concept of balance. In a chemical reaction there is conservation of energy and mass. So even though things are changing, nothing is really gained or lost. A catalyst does nothing to disrupt this balance, and only makes the changes happen more easily. In chemistry the word for balance is equilibrium. There is a misconception that reactions are a one way street and after the reactants become products the reaction is over. In reality most reactions are never 'over' since products can reform reactants and the system remains in constant motion in both directions. At some point a balance is reached, though, and the process reaches equilibrium. At this point the amount of reactants and products becomes constant. There are some 'stresses' that can be put on the system to disrupt this equilibrium such as changing temperature or applying pressure, but the reaction will push back against these stresses to find equilibrium again. A catalyst is not one of these stresses, instead it helps the system find equilibrium faster.

So, by working in accordance with the Tao we are able to help achieve balance in our work and lives. Applying stress only disrupts the balance that will be found with or without us, so we should stay true to our nature and work with the flow."

taoism,Magnum Opus,"The path to reaching the ultimate observations and conclusions is a personal path; as the path is personal, so are the conclusions and observations.

Follow your own way; as you discover truths, continue to change and incorperate the wisdom of direct understanding.

Everything is one.

For one person, the truth might look like an apple,

For another, the truth might look like an orange.

For one it might take ten seconds to reach ""oneness""

For another, it might take a lifetime, or many lifetimes, to reach ""oneness""

Does that mean either way is wrong? 

No; it's the personal way.

Regardless of the path you take, or the things you abide in, you are going to reach the same destination.

.

To summarize,

The truth is personal,

The road to truth is personal.

........

Life is like a sandbox, so have fun playing and building your castles. 

Every time you build a castle, you'll do it quicker and better each time.  

If you notice that a specific thing hinders the ability to build your castle, stop it. 

Don't do this or that because someone told you to.

If you think doing a certain thing will help you, do it. You will either succeed, or fail.

So observe and exert true wisdom, true understanding, true growth.

If you succeed, capture that success for as long as it lasts.

If you fail, try something that might work.

Don't do as you're told, because one thing that works for another, might not work for you.

That doesn't mean being blind to the guidance and knowledge of others,

That means take everything with a grain of salt, and do you. 

This is how you can make the distinction between ""right"" and ""wrong"". 

Do what works for you, and don't do what hinders you. 

Often things these little hinderances or advantages can't be described. Don't try. Just do what works, and don't do what doesn't. Sometimes you might mess up and do what you ""shouldn't"", but that can be a good thing. 

Life constantly changes, and your growth has unlimited potential. Learn from what doesn't work, and enjoy what does work.

Just because you go through a rough patch, just because you might do ""wrong"", that doesn't mean you're ""wrong"". 

Make your mistakes without regret; I've noticed that sometimes you need to do ""wrong"" in order to do ""right"".

Everything constantly changes, so why would you think just because you did ""wrong"", you are ""wrong""?

Rather than giving up or dwelling on something, observe every experience in life, and think about how you can grow from it. 

Sometimes you'll make the same mistake twice, that's okay.

Make your mistakes without regret and do you.

If you're extremely stubborn, so will the world be in persistently giving you chances to grow, 

........

Eventually you will realize the error of your ways, if there's error to be found.

Eventually you will come to a state of true wisdom and understanding. 

Eventually you will build the perfect castle with no effort.

Eventually you will be perfected and live life effortlessly. 

~~~~~

You should be wise and observe the many facets of life,

But you should never be unwise in making one specific way your personal way, or one specific truth your personal truth.

Change is the only constant, therefore the wise man flows with life and observes, changing with the world.

Just as the truth is flexible and infinite, so should you be.

To limit yourself in understanding by labeling any one thing as this or that, is foolish.

Things are only so and must be left at so.

Ying and Yang; there may be a distinction, but both equal one together.

To label anything as this or that based upon the values and judgement of others, is foolish.
If you label anything, label it truly.

Things are so. Trying to expand past so is often times quite foolish and unnecessary.

Distinctions may need to be made sometimes,

Remember that there's always two sides to the coin, so don't just limit your understanding to one side of the coin,

See the value in the valueless, the good in evil, the evil in good, the wrong in right, the right in wrong.

Don't label something as head or tail just because it appears that way.

Understand it to be one of two, only understanding the distinction because it's obvious, and don't take it past so.

See the facets of life, and understand the counterparts. Recognize that the two aren't that different, and see them as one.

All things are one, and while there may be a distinction between the parts that make up one whole thing,

Labeling a certain distinction as this or that is wrong,

Label it as so, and don't take it past so.

See past one distinction, see all the distinctions,

And see how they all come together and work in harmony.

See how all things have their place,

See how all things work in unison and harmony. 

.......

There is no need to act a specific way,

In trying to act a specific way, you limit yourself.

In trying to think a specific way, you limit yourself.

Instead of thinking you should do this or that,

Do this or that.

Water is flexible,

You should be like water.

............

Stay in the moment; not as a result of striving to stay in the moment, a result of not striving / not dwelling on the fetters of life

Be spontaneously reactive; a result of letting the true self shine through the conditioned behaviors of the ""logical"" or ""intelligent"" self,

See past the lenses of life (see the modified version of my post ""More Understandings"" further down this post to understand my meaning of the lenses of life ~~ I would consider that post to be obsolete but still useful ~~ I've cut a lot of filler and nonsense out when editing that post into this one)

See all as one and react as you will without conditioned behavior. React naturally, letting your deeper self guide your actions.

Have good virtue; benevolence is a result of nothing ~ in striving to have ""good virtue"", you give yourself a reason to act a specific way, true benevolence is a result of seeing all things as one and acting according to the principles of nature and the true self. Treat the people as the heavens treat the people; as a straw dog. Once you can master the principle of not striving, you can master the principle of true benevolence, real virtue.

But, even though I give you this widsom, trying to replicate these specific words of advice would be foolish.

These conclusions are a result of nonstriving, therefore striving to come to the same conclusions would lead you astray.

To come to conclusions naturally and see them naturally, integrate them into your life naturally; that's the result of personal progress.

........

In abiding in wu-wei and not striving, practicing unattached action, you will find your conclusions and observations.

The end result is the same,

The path leading to that result is very different for each person,

This is personal progress.

~~~~~

Here's my old post ""More Understandings"" edited:

We all embrace the Dao and its spontaneous style; if not knowingly, unknowingly. However for those not embracing the Dao by choice, they do so through a clouded means. They seek to find permanence within the fact of change. To find anything they can cling onto; to hold it dearly and struggle to keep it and own it. You can think of it as a cycle of suffering. The path to ending the cycle is simple, yet so complicated due to the self. It is our very nature to keep the cycle going; it is ingrained in us deep to cling onto that which can never be clung onto. To seek what can never be found, to approach the unapproachable. It is our very nature to contest our own nature; that is the human stubbornness and determination.

.........

You can think of it as seeing the world through a lens. A lens of judgement, a lens of forethought, a lens of desire, and a lens of knowledge.

.........

A lens of judgement; The decision to label something as good or bad, desirable or undesirable. The decision to label anything a certain way; acting dependent on that label. True understanding is not the result of logic, thought, or decisions; true understanding is a result of a direct observation. If something is so, something is so. What more can there be? It has no qualities, it is just so, and must be understood as so. By the same nature, you must represent yourself. Act naturally and be who you are, just so.

..........

A lens of forethought; instead of embracing change and reacting spontaneously to life based on our deeper, more primal desires and instincts, we sought to use logic and “intelligence” to solve our problems. The solution is not to think things out, and act based on false misconceptions; the solution is to live in the moment, embrace change and spontaneity, and to act dependent only on our true nature and instincts.

..............

Change is Dao

Spontaneity is Dao

How can we bridge the gap between such things and humanity?

Reactive action, instead of action riddled with forethought.

There comes spontaneously reactive action.

Instead of acting dependent on logic and thought, we should act dependent on our instincts.

Here we are, in the moment completely,

Going with the flow and naturally representing ourselves,

Reacting to situations and things spontaneously, with the right mindset of natural instinct.

............

A lens of desire; true desire is different from the desires built upon the lens of judgement. Many people see things as one way or another, and any desire built upon such a principle is twisted by nature. We strive to have things because it is seen as favorable or unfavorable to have or not to have. True desire is instinctual, and comes from the deeper self. It is dependent on nothing and is understood clearly. When such a situation arises in which you instinctively desire something; I say be spontaneous and reactive in your entertainment of that desire. Keep in mind that dwelling on the fetters of life is an easy way to distract yourself from the path of knowledge.

............

Dwelling on a desire is a powerful source of suffering. Your reactions to instincts should be spontaneous and natural. If life hands you an opportunity to embrace a pleasure, embrace it if you wish. However, don’t start chasing it, or dwelling on it past completion. Living here in the moment, you give and take. Enjoy it until completion and then give it back, forgetting about it until it comes up once more. Some people lack the strength to control themselves. This is why the way of ""eliminating desire"" works for many. To those that can surpass the need to ""eliminate desire"" or ""bask in the rewards"", I salute you.

.............

A lens of knowledge; this lens causes humans to overthink and overanalyze, using logic as the tool to do so. Instead of observing and understanding, they would use logic to put together knowledge in a backwards, twisted way. The lens of judgement is a chief barrier in true understanding, and true knowledge. True knowledge and understanding requires no effort to attain because it should be observed directly, and understood directly. If something is so, why must you take it past so? Understand it as so, and don’t try to explain it through ways that could never explain it as so. It is so, and understanding it as so is how you can learn to understand and know as so.

...........

Subtle cannot be explained or understood through conventional human judgement, or through the logic driven thought-process. Subtle cannot be acted upon in fundamentally twisted ways, either. True knowledge and understanding cannot be attained in such a way, or acted upon in such a way. So what can you do? Live in the moment and spontaneously react, embracing things as they are, acting upon them as they are, enjoying them as they are, and knowing them as they are. This is called wu-wei, or effortless action, the gateway to becoming a Zhenren and one with the Dao.

..............

On one of my posts a user named acidsaint wrote something very interesting; it took a long time for me to see the wisdom in it,

""There is nothing to be done. Only to be understood. How can one not live in the moment? There is literally no where else that you could live. The more you try to live in the moment the more you depart from it. A buddha doesn't have to try to live in the moment. Its just natural. Return to your natural state of being doesn't mean anything but exist as you are right now. Do not hate yourself for hating yourself and do not hate yourself for not hating yourself. Accept the non acceptance.""

Anyway, i've gotten very interested in my Taoist roots (we are all born into our lives for a reason eh) and i heard this quote by 老子 (Lao Tzu):
""If you look everywhere and you cannot find what you seek, then what you seek is already in your possession.""

taoism,What are the early life benefits of Taoism?,"I first learned of the Dao from Alan Watts, and he described it as ""a philosophy for older people, something to do when you're done with career and kids and need something to do to your time. Find out who you really are, where you really fit in to everything"".

Taoism is a wonderful philosophy in that it teaches the acceptance of change, which is clearly present in all life time. My main concern is that with it, it bestows a certain stoicism to the outlook of circumstances. Whatever happens happens and ultimately you need accept whatever happens in each moment. If this is how you approach life in your youth, it's possible to miss forming valuable opinions over your development. Thats why it's so much more valuable later in life, because then your major decisions have already been made, that's the time for reflective acceptance.

So, to restate, what are the benefits for Taoism in the early steps of our modern way of life? (18-30)"

Like entering into a hottub from cold air. My consciousness transitions from standard nothing special, to appreciation, serenity, and cognizance of non duality.


Sometimes, what triggers this shift is a simple glance to the wide open sky. Other times, I hear a few words that click just right, and I'm in. Just looking at the Tao te Ching can do it somedays, and sometimes I could read 5 chapters and never get there.


What do you think about the concept of triggers as I've discussed? Is there causation? Do they tend to be repeatable for you? How might it relate to the Tao as a path, or great Course?"

taoism,"Taoism from a skeptical, somewhat-scientific point of view","Taoism describes how to be happy/content with one’s life through meditation and changes in mindset which may lead to open-mindedness, tolerance, and relaxation (depending on how you view the these three words). It allows one to make decisions quicker with less overthinking. It suggests that we are all interconnected in the Tao, and that we all affect one another, including inanimate objects such as rocks, the sky, and galaxies billions of light years away. Understanding this allows us to let go of the illusion of the individual, as we are made up of our parts, and we are all parts of the universe/Tao, and yet we are one whole. We are currently part of the Tao, part of the whole, in the flow with the universe, and when we die we will still be part of the Tao. We will be part of the “metaphysical” reality, or in other words, we will be abiding by the same exact laws of physics after we die and when our cells/atoms/elementary particles go in separate directions, it will be almost no different than when we are alive as 30,000 cells in our body self-destruct every minute and all atoms in our bodies are replaced every 7 years. Dying will simply change our frame of reference. Taoism describes change as a way of life, and it can lead to self-love/self-acceptance as Taoism helps us realize we are all interconnected and the same entity. Please understand, however, that Taoism cannot be defined with words and what I’ve described is what only can be seen on the surface from a skeptical mind. It goes a lot deeper than this.

taoism,"Is the Tao and Camus's ""The Absurd"" the same?","I've been branching out from Taoist philosophy and taking a look at Camus's Absurdism.  The idea of ""The Absurd"" seemed like another approach to the concept of the Tao.  The key difference being that while the Tao is a recognition of a natural order that human beings are foolish to try to escape, circumvent, or ""go against"", the absurd is a recognition of inherent disorder and meaninglessness to the universe that human beings are foolish to try to ascribe our own meaning or purpose to.

There are several passages in TTC that describe the Tao in seemingly similar terms describing its nature is not to reward or condemn or play favorites or dole out accolades and criticisms it just is... similar to Camus's assertion that our solution to dealing with The Absurd is to embrace it and choose to be happy in spite of the ultimate meaninglessness of it all.

Maybe an impossible task.  It just feels very heavy, knowing the past will never change and that is very, oh so very valuable for growth and change but when wounds are fresh maybe it just feels more tender :)  Anyway.. the point of this post is -

Has anyone ever wanted to spread positive feelings,etc even to those that have done 'wrong' to you(not the hard part), but feel this internal struggle of sadness from the past/affecting now(harder part) and how have you dealt with it/how would the tao express this.

taoism,Final Understandings,"**Detached action**

Living in the moment,

Going with the flow,

Spontaneously reactive to life based on deeper instincts,

Accepting the pleasures of life as they come, giving them up as they go,

Detached from traditional life and truly living as a result,

Detached from desire and pursuit of any state of being or phenomena,

Only here and now, flowing through life.

*

Knowledge is a chief barrier of wisdom, of understanding, of peace.

I say that the intellectual mind must be destroyed,

I say that logic dirven knowledge is irrelevant, 

When a man knows nothing, he knows all there is to know,

There are no elaborate rituals or rules to follow,

There is only here and now,

Not for or against any phenomena or state of being

Seeing all as one; a right mindset and view of the world

True serenity is a result of detachment from traditional life,

Truly living is a result of foregoing everything but the spontaneous moment.

Truly living is returning to the state of old, letting go of the “evolved” human mind, intelligence, logic, ext. for a simpler mind of true understanding and wisdom, true spontaneity and virtue, one of true detachment.

*

See “More Understandings” for a view of obstacles people face in reaching spontaneity and oneness with Dao.

This might be my last post. I have finally reached oneness and while these words may be simple, no more is required in order to progress or understand.

Since there's so many ideas going around, I thought it best to be put into sections that flowed with each other. The dots are just for formatting. Most of this comes from the Daodejing, but I've expanded on it a bit, formatted it, blah blah. Also when using the pronoun for Sage, the translation had ""Sage"" labeled as she, and I didn't feel the need to edit it to he. S/he, who cares. Anyways, here we go.

~

Things may be named separately, but by being named as separate, they are whole. Within beauty lies ugliness, within good lies evil; both are one, both complete each other. The distinction is a created one, made through the lens of judgement. (see my other post ""More Understandings"" for an explanation of the lens of judgement)

.

Precense and absence produce each other.

Difficulty and ease bring about each other.

Long and short delimit each other. 

High and low rest on each other.

Sound and voice harmonize each other.

Front and back follow each other. 

.

Therefore the Way that can be followed is not the eternal Way; The name that can be named is not the eternal name. Therefore always desireless, you see the mystery; always desiring, you see the manifestations. These two are the same, yet when they appear they are named differently. Therefore the sage desires not to desire, and sees the manifestation of mystery. The sameness is the mystery, mystery within mystery; the door to all marvels.

.

Therefore the sage abides in the condition of wu-wei (unattached action), and carries out the wordless teaching. Here, the myriad things are made, yet not separated.

.

The Sage gives birth to it, and nourishes it.

The Sage understands herself, but does not show herself.

The Sage loves herself, but does not prize herself.

The Sage produces it, but doesn't posess it.

The Sage acts without expectation.

The Sage does not promote herself, and has success.

The Sage does not affirm herself, and therefore shines.

The Sage excells, but doesn't take charge.

The Sage gives and takes.

The Sage does not show herself, and therefore is apparent.

The Sage abides in the thick, not the thin.

The Sage does not boast, and therefore has merit.

The Sage does not strive, and is therefore successful.

The Sage accomplishes without abiding in the accomplishments; it is because she does not abide in them, that they never leave her.

Accomplish without boast

Accomplish without show

Accomplish without arrogance

Accomplish without grabbing

Accomplish without forcing.

It is exactly because she does not contend, that nobody can contend with her.

This is called Mysterious Virtue.

~~~~

You should emulate the Way in your being, Heaven and Earth last forever. 

They do not give birth to themselves, therefore they are always alive.

Hence, the sage puts herself last and is first.

She is detached from herself and therefore her self lasts.

Through her selflessness, she is able to perfect herself.

.

When you are humble, attainment is a surprise, and so is loss.

If you dedicate your life for the benefit of the world,

You can rely on the world.

If you love dedicating yourself in this way,

You can be entrusted with the world.

If I have no self, how could I experience misfortune?

Highest good is like water; it easily benefits all things without struggle, yet abides in places that men hate. 

~~~~

To speak little is natural.

Therefore a gale does not blow a whole morning

Nor does a downpour last a whole day.

Who does these things? Heaven and Earth.

If even Heaven and Earth cannot force perfect continuity, how can people expect to?

.

Therefore there is such a thing as aligning one's actions with the Way.

.

If you accord with the Way you become one with it.

If you accord with virtue you become one with it.

If you accord with loss you become one with it.

The Way accepts this accordance gladly.

Virtue accepts this accordance gladly.

Loss also accepts accordance gladly.

~~~~

Heaven and earth are not humane,

And regard the people as straw dogs.

The sage is not humane,

and regards all things as straw dogs.

.

To expand using Sue Zhe's commentary:

""Heaven and Earth are not partial. They do not kill living things out of cruelty or give them birth out of kindness. We do the same when we make straw dogs to use in sacrifices. We dress them up and put them on the altar, but not because we love them. And when the ceremony is over, we throw them into the street, but not because we hate them.""

~~~~

If you value rarities, you will cause people to steal

If people see desirables, they will be agitated

Therefore when the sage governs,

He clears the people's minds,

Fills their bellies,

Weakens their ambitions and

Strengthens their bones.

.

If people are kept without cleverness and desire

It will make the ""intellectuals"" not dare to meddle

Acting without contrivance, there is no lack of manageability.

.

The five colors blind our eyes.

The five tones deafen our ears.

The five flavors confuse our taste.

Racing and hunting madden our minds.

Possessing rare treasures brings about harmful behavior.

Therefore the sage acts from his gut, and not from his eyes; therefore the sage gives and takes.

.

Therefore the sage practices wu-wei and observes, and through observing knows the constant. Knowing this constant he is illuminated, and his knowing of the constant is receptivity. Receptivity is impartial, impartial is kingship, kingship is heaven, heaven is the Way, the Way is eternal, and therefore the sage is eternal.

.

Get rid of “holiness” and abandon “wisdom"" and the people will benefit a hundredfold.

Get rid of “humaneness” and abandon “rightness”and the people will return to filial piety and compassion.

Get rid of cleverness and abandon profit, and thieves and gangsters will not exist.

.

Since the above three are merely words, they are not sufficient; Therefore there must be something to include them all.

See the origin and keep the non-differentiated state.

Lessen selfishness and decrease desire.

~~~~

The ancient masters of the Way had subtle and marvelous mystic penetration.

A depth that cannot be known; it is exactly because that they are unknowable, that we are forced to pay attention to their appearance.

.

Hesitant, like one crossing an ice-covered river.

Ready, like one afraid of his neighbors on all sides.

Dignified, like a guest.

Loose, like ice about to melt.

Straightforward, like an uncarved block of wood.

Open, like a valley.

Obscure, like muddy water.

.

Who can be muddled, and use clarity to gradually become lucid?

Who can be calm, and use constant application for eventual success?

The one who holds to this path does not crave fulfillment.

Precisely because she does not crave fulfillment, she can be shattered, and do without quick restitution.

~~~~

When people are born they are gentle and soft.

At death they are hard and stiff.

When plants are alive they are soft and delicate.

When they die, they wither and dry up.

Therefore the hard and stiff are followers of death.

The gentle and soft are the followers of life.

.

Thus, if you are aggressive and stiff, you won't win.

When a tree is hard enough, it is cut. Therefore

The hard and big are lesser,

The gentle and soft are greater.

.

If you are courageous in daring you will die.

If you are courageous in not-daring you will live.

.

Among these two, one is beneficial and the other is harmful.

.

The Way of Heaven is to win easily without struggle.

To respond well without words,

To naturally come without special invitation,

To plan well without anxiety.

Heaven's net is vast.

It is loose, yet nothing slips through.

.

Strategists have a saying:

I prefer to be able to move, rather than be in a fixed position

I prefer to retreat a foot rather than advancing an inch.

This is called progress without advancing;

Preparing without showing off;

Smashing where there is no defense;

Taking him without a fight.

.

There is no greater danger than under-estimating your opponent.

If I under-estimate my opponent

I will lose that which is most dear.

.

The best warrior is never aggressive.

The best fighter is never angry.

The best tactician does not engage the enemy.

The best utilizer of people's talents places himself below them.

.

This is called the virtue of non-contention.

It is called the ability to engage people's talents.

It is called the ultimate in merging with Heaven.

.

I have three treasures that I hold and cherish.

The first is compassion, the second is frugality, the third is not daring to put myself ahead of everybody.

.

Having compassion, I can be brave.

Having frugality, I can be generous.

Not daring to put myself ahead of everybody, I can take the time to perfect my abilities.

.

Now if I am brave without compassion, generous without frugality, or go to the fore without putting my own concerns last, I might as well be dead.

.

If you wage war with compassion you will win.

If you protect yourself with compassion you will be impervious.

.

That which is at rest is easy to grasp.

That which has not yet come about is easy to plan for.

That which is fragile is easily broken.

That which is minute is easily scattered.

Handle things before they arise.

Manage affairs before they are in a mess.

.

A thick tree grows from a tiny seed.

A tall building arises from a mound of earth.

A journey of a thousand miles starts with one step.

Contriving, you are defeated;

Grasping, you lose.

.

The sage doesn't contrive, so she isn't beaten.

Not grasping, she doesn't lose.

When people are carrying out their projects

They usually blow it at the end.

.

If you are as careful at the end

As you were at the beginning,

You won't be disappointed.

.

Therefore the sage desires non-desire,

Does not value rare goods,

Studies the unlearnable

So that she can correct the mistakes of average people

And aid all things in manifesting their true nature.

.

Respond to anger with virtue.

Deal with difficulties while they are still easy.

Handle the great while it is still small.

.

The difficult problems of life

Always start off being simple.

Great affairs always start off being small.

Therefore the sage never deals with the great

And is able to actualize his greatness.

.

Now light words generate little belief,

Much ease turns into much difficulty.

Therefore the sage treats things as though they were difficult, and hence, never has difficulty.

.

I do not force my way and the people transform themselves.

I enjoy my serenity and the people correct themselves.

I do not interfere and the people enrich themselves.

I have no desires, and the people find their original mind.

.

One who knows does not speak.

One who speaks does not know.

Close your holes, shut your doors,

Soften your sharpness, loosen your knots.

Soften your glare and merge with the everyday.

This is called mysteriously attaining oneness.

.

Though you cannot possess it, you are intimate with it, and at the same time, distant.

Though you cannot possess it, you are benefited by it, and harmed by it.

You cannot possess it, but are esteemed through it, and humbled by it.

Therefore the world values you.

~~~~

Way gives birth to it,

Virtue rears it,

Materiality shapes it,

Activity perfects it.

Therefore, there are none of the myriad things who do not venerate the Way or esteem its virtue.

.

This veneration of the Way and esteeming of its virtue is something they do naturally, without being forced.

.

Therefore, the Way gives birth.

Its virtue rears, develops, raises, adjusts and disciplines,

Nourishes, covers and protects,

Produces but does not possess,

Acts without expectation,

Leads without forcing.

.

This is called “Mysterious Virtue.”

~~~~

The sage has no fixed mind,

She takes the mind of the people as her mind.

.

I treat the good as good, I also treat the evil as good.

This is true goodness.

I trust the trustworthy, I also trust the untrustworthy.

This is real trust.

.

When the sage lives with people, she harmonizes with them

And conceals her mind for them.

The sages treat them as their little children.

.

In studying, each day something is gained.

In following the Way, each day something is lost.

Lost and again lost.

Until there is nothing left to do.

Not-doing, nothing is left undone.

You can possess the world by never manipulating it.

No matter how much you manipulate

You can never possess the world.

~~~~

Superior virtue is not virtuous, therefore it has virtue. Superior virtue does not “act”, and has no intentions.

Inferior virtue never fails to be virtuous, therefore it has no virtue. Inferior virtue “acts”, and always has intentions.

Superior humaneness “acts”, but has no intentions. Superior rightness “acts”, but but has intentions.

Superior propriety “acts” and if you don't respond, they will roll up their sleeves and threaten you.

.

Thus, when the Way is lost there is virtue

When virtue is lost there is humaneness

When humaneness is lost there is rightness

And when rightness is lost there is propriety.

.

Now “propriety” is the external appearance of loyalty and sincerity, and the beginning of disorder.

Occult abilities are just flowers of the Way, and the beginning of foolishness.

Therefore the Great Person dwells in the substantial, and not in the superficial.

Rests in the fruit and not in the flower. So let go of that and grasp this.

I was just reading through the Daodejing, and wrote this. If you're curious about the translation you can find it here: http://www.acmuller.net/con-dao/daodejing.html

All I did was add some of my own stuff (just a bit, nothing added conflicts with the statements or mindset of the Daodejing, just usually a further explanation ie the understanding of the straw dog bit), switch stuff around, basically just compile it alllll together in a way that flows for me. You might notice there's some stuff missing, there's just some stuff that isn't needed for me as I've already understood it to a continuous level, or is repetitive. Once again, you can check that link out to view the Daodejing if you'd like, I love the translation. If this helps someone, I'm thankful, but posting this has no goal. Just sharing to sharing.

taoism,More Understandings ~~,"The universe is something quite interesting.
And so is the individual journey that each person has to go through.
So vastly different and unique; yet all one and pedestrian.

We all embrace the Dao and its spontaneous style; if not knowingly, unknowingly. 
However for those not embracing the Dao by choice, they do so through a clouded means.
They seek to find permanence within the fact of change.
To find anything they can cling onto; to hold it dearly and struggle to keep it and own it.
You can think of it as a cycle of suffering.
The path to ending the cycle is simple, yet so complicated due to the self. It is our very nature to keep the cycle going; it is ingrained in us deep to cling onto that which can never be clung onto. To seek what can never be found, to approach the unapproachable. It is our very nature to contest our own nature; that is the human stubbornness and determination.

You can think of it as seeing the world through a lens.
A lens of judgement, a lens of forethought, a lens of desire, and a lens of knowledge.

A lens of judgement; The decision to label something as good or bad, desirable or undesirable. The decision to label anything a certain way; acting dependent on that label. True understanding is not the result of logic, thought, or decisions; true understanding is a result of a direct observation. If something is so, something is so. What more can there be? It has no qualities, it is just so, and must be understood as so. By the same nature, you must represent yourself. Act naturally and be who you are, just so.

A lens of forethought; instead of embracing change and reacting spontaneously to life based on our deeper, more primal desires and instincts, we sought to use logic and “intelligence” to solve our problems. The solution is not to think things out, and act based on false misconceptions; the solution is to live in the moment, embrace change and spontaneity, and to act dependent only on our true nature and instincts.

Change is the Dao

Spontaneity is the Dao

How can we bridge the gap between such things and humanity?

Reactive action, instead of action riddled with forethought.

There comes spontaneously reactive action.

Instead of acting dependent on logic, we should act dependent on our instincts.

Here we are, in the moment completely,

Going with the flow and naturally representing ourselves,

Reacting to situations and things spontaneously, with the right mindset of natural instinct.

A lens of desire; true desire is different from the desires built upon the lens of judgement. Many people see things as one way or another, and any desire built upon such a principle is twisted by nature. We strive to have things because it is seen as favorable or unfavorable to have or not to have. True desire is instinctual, and comes from the deeper self. It is dependent on nothing and is understood clearly.  When such a situation arises in which you instinctively desire something; I say be spontaneous and reactive in your entertainment of that desire.

Dwelling on a desire is a powerful source of suffering. Your reactions to instincts should be spontaneous and natural. If life hands you an opportunity to embrace a pleasure, embrace it. However, don’t start chasing it, or dwelling on it past completion. Living here in the moment, you give and take. Enjoy it until completion and then give it back, forgetting about it until it comes up once more.

A lens of knowledge,
This lens causes humans to overthink and overanalyze, using logic as the tool to do so.
Instead of observing and understanding, they would use logic to put together their knowledge in a backwards, twisted way. The lens of judgement is a chief barrier in true understanding, and true knowledge. True knowledge and understanding requires no effort to attain because it should be observed directly, and understood directly. If something is so, why must you take it past so? Understand it as so, and don’t try to explain it through ways that could never explain it as so. It is so, and understanding it as so is how you can learn to understand and know as so.

Change is the only constant, therefor the sage flows with change, embracing spontaneously reactive action. The sage sees past good or bad, sees past right or wrong; for the sage, all is one.

Mystery and more mystery; the gate of all that is subtle. (line from the Daodejing)
Subtle cannot be explained or understood through conventional human judgement, or through the logic driven thought-process. Subtle cannot be acted upon in such fundamentally twisted ways, either. True knowledge and understanding cannot be attained in such a way, or acted upon in such a way. So what can you do? Live in the moment and spontaneously react, embracing things as they are, acting upon them as they are, enjoying them as they are, and knowing them as they are. This is called wu-wei, or effortless action, the gateway to becoming a Zhenren and one with the Dao.

Why did humans start to see through these lenses? You can think of it as a singular moment within history that sparked a chain reaction within the world itself. The instantaneous development of the flawed ""intellectual” mind. 

Curiosity lead to a discovery. That discovery led humans to shift their mindset from a content, spontaneously reactive one, to one of false knowledge and understanding, one of striving and planning. More and more humans learned and learned, more and more did they strive and plan. And thus the cycle of suffering began.

We went from hunter / gatherers and entered the Neolithic Revolution, but we did so in the wrong way, for the wrong reasons. We desired an easier life, and we started planning how we could make it easier. In doing so, we fell prey to our own self created cycle, and here we are today. We have everything, yet, we have nothing.

This was my most recent writing. Will not be debating or arguing with others. If you hold a different opinion, that's fine. These posts are just posts of my observations &amp; understandings, I'm hoping it can help others. If it can't help you, it can't help you.
Cheers everyone! I think this might be my last one."
taoism,Anyone here a Christian Taoist?,"Ive recently been looking into Taoism and its has made my life better in ways that no other religion can. It helps me accept the things that suck and appreciate them in order to live more happily. Furthermore, it helps get rid of any anxiety I sometimes have because awkwardness and anxiety doesn't align with my natural personality and therefore I feel happier and more liberated. It is of my understanding that Taoism as a pure philosophy can mesh with Christianity as it doesn't idolize a creator ""God"" or Messiah. Any thought on this? I've been raised Christian and although I'm on the fence about Christianity right now, I believe that perhaps the two can blend well. Anyone here have experience with both? The Tao has always been the way through time but is it possible that there is a creator God as well who set the Tao in motion or came as a result of the Tao or that Jesus was the Tao incarnate?"

Should I stop after every small section and think about it? I have only read the first section (not sure what to call them actually, but I read through the part titled Embodying the Tao) and it made a lot of sense. Should I discuss these parts with others?"

taoism,Understandings of a Wise Man,"*Edit~ Put the Wise Man part of the title in quotes, I didn't mean to sound arrogant, but after reflection I did realize it was an arrogant statement.

Earlier the moment I waited seemingly all my life for happened, and I wanted to write this to share with others. I have struggled so long for this moment, but it is so emotionally significant to me I guess for a few minutes I just kinda had to enjoy it. Anyways,

Here it goes:

One universal truth is the truth of change. Every moment is a new moment and this represents the way I live. I live in the moment completely, and go with the flow.

While I may think about the past or future, I never dwell on such things, and never make plans that aren't immediate. This also represents the way I treat desire. If life gives me an opportunity to indulge in a pleasure, I will. However, when that moment is over, it's over. I may not forget about it, but I won't dwell on it or try to recreate it. Like I said, each moment is a new moment and my mindset is going with the flow. The Daodejing says ""The Sage gives and takes"", and this statement is 100% true.

For me, there is no good or bad, everything is one. I act naturally, ie society doesn't influence my actions or thoughts or decisions. A wise man is a ""stupid"" man by choice, do you know why?

Right and wrong are things humans created through a vastly limited mindset, and so is modern day knowledge. Humans are very judgemental creatures and the basis of most people's knowledge and opinions is logic and judgement. Ie humans trying to fit in with others and continuing the cycle of sheep bullshit. There's a huge difference between thinking you know something, thinking you understand something, and truly knowing and truly understanding. True knowledge and understanding doesn't require logic or opinions of others or things built on the minds of others to be found. Why? Because it can be observed clearly and trying to explain it or trying to understand it through logic would only limit the subtle truths of life. We can look at nature and see this true wisdom and understanding with animals. Do you think a dog thinks about why it's defending its owner from an attacker? Do you think a dog stops to think if it should bark or not? Do you think a dog thinks about someone watching while it's taking a piss? Do you think the dog thinks about the way it looks, or is stressing about ANYTHING beside that immediate moment? Do you think the dog is trying to impress others or trying to live the same way as other dogs? Not at all. The dog is REACTIVE to life and is COMPLETELY SPONTANEOUS, the wisdom of the dog comes through direct interactions and direct observations. The dog is going with the flow, living in the moment, not worried about the past or future. I can only imagine the potential of humanity if we changed our ways. The Dao is diminishing and reversing, but in doing so it gives the potential for the most growth and forward direction.


**Edit:
(As I experience more and feel like I have more useful things to add I'm going to edit this and add more)

Just remember. Act naturally, flow naturally. You don't need to strive to be a ""good"" person, or strive to be anything really. There's no reason for you to fit any sort of mold. Yes, it may be a journey for you to flip the switch, but once you come to this point and you reach wu-wei, you don't have to think about how to act or what to do, your actions naturally reflect the Dao, and spontaneous action. Did you realize I didn't tell anyone how to live during this post, or what to do? This was a post of observations and understandings that I've experienced. Because there is no ""one fit all"" solution, your path is as valid as any other's path. I believe a key reason for humans becoming so foolish is because they're trying to base their opinions and knowledge from others. For example, yes the Daodejing may be a key asset in your journey, or things like meditation, or even things like drugs, BUT those things should never BE your journey, that's my opinion at least. Everything should come from within because it is YOUR way. EVERYONE is beautiful in their own way, and it is SO angering to me that society would have you believe otherwise. Even if right now you are the most evil, despicable, stubborn, arrogant, and most childish person on the planet, that's who you are RIGHT NOW. Once you flow with life and continue to grow and change, your actions will start to reflect the Dao, and you won't have to think about being ""good"" or ""bad"", you will find your peace and place within this world. If my post helps you in some way, I'm glad, but your wu-wei and eventual state of Zhenren should come from within, not from others. Naturalness can never be stressed enough."
taoism,Examples of wu wei and forced action?,"Hi! So, I think I have a *decent* grasp of the concept of wu wei. I understand what it isn’t and what it is, but not on a very deep level. I was wondering if some of you could give some real life example situations, and show what wu wei would look like there and what going against Dao would look like. Looking for something less metaphorical and more like a modern world scenario just to kind of triple check my concepts and better grasp how to improve flowing with Dao.

Thank you! "
taoism,How to be content and ambitious?,"Lately I’ve been struggling with balancing two lessons that seem to oppose each other. In life, to survive and do more than just barely make it through, you have to work constantly and actually with effort. While this doesn’t mean the work should cause stress or anger or less sleep (except some rare days) or even taking away time to be mindful in the day, I struggle with doing my best on work that I rather not do if I don’t permit myself the ambitious attitude I see in successful people (in which I define success as people who live happily and are able to do what they love). How do I keep envy and ego and such in my life, and keep contentment and non-attachment, while still working my hardest to achieve my best possible results?"

For a Structural-Functionalist sociologist, that list of highlights is a veritable wet dream. Wikipedia isn't the most trustworthy resource though, and even if true, for all I know, that could be the cultural worldview of the Chinese people separate from Taoism. So, is their a basis for this in Taoist literature? Do the western Taoists on here tend to feel this is accurate to them?"
taoism,"內,Nei,Inner [Excerpt From Everyday Tao Living with Balance and Harmony]","&gt; Nei. Inner, within, inside. The angle shape at the top means ""to enter."" The upside down U shape of the remainder of the word represents a room or a house.

&gt;The ability to persevere comes only from inner strength.

&gt; The ability to persevere comes from inside ourselves. Nothing outside can give it to us. **When circumstances are against us, when life tries us to our very core, when all other resources are closed to us, we must have an inner well from which we can draw power.** It is like a castle in ancient times besieged by attackers. If it has its own well and its own provisions, it can hold fast until aid comes. 

&gt; The difference between survival and destruction is often the difference between how strong one's inner resources are. People look at the methods of following Tao and wonder why there is so much emphasis on preparing and training oneself. After all, the standards of the ancients are so much higher than what is normally regarded as necessary. This need for inner strength is one of the most compelling reasons for study. Life is not given to us, and fortune comes and goes without any warning. Therefore, it is wisdom to have the inner reserves to withstand the lassitudes of life. It is only our inner will and energy that can be stronger than misfortune. 

&gt; **The wisdom of Tao is to know the flow of the outer world. But the genius of Tao is to establish and sustain the inner force of a person. That is our only hope of lasting long enough to follow Tao to the end.**

taoism,Alan Watts~ Don't Take Life Too Seriously...,
taoism,The Tao of Calculus,"The axiom of Taoism is that change is the fundamental nature of all things. This implies that the mechanics of change are foundational to conscious perception. Calculus is the mathematics of change, consisting of integrals which compute cumulative change such as total distance traveled, and derivatives which are rates of change such as velocity. The fundamental theorem of Calculus shows that derivatives and integrals are inverse operations of the same process, exactly corresponding to the definition of The Tao as the way things come together, while still transforming. Integration is yang and derivation yin in mathematically pure form.

While the above argument is self-consistent, if it is true it should actually describe conscious perception empirically. If it is capable of describing, it should also be capable of application as technologies of perception and praxis. I will demonstrate these in turn.

[Here are the fundamental correlates of perceptual Calculus.](https://i.imgur.com/bWLvr4k.jpg) The top three have already been described, but the Being and Doing modes of consciousness are two different reference frames of perceived time. These are described in [""The Mindful Way Workbook""](https://www.amazon.com/Mindful-Way-Workbook-Depression-Emotional/dp/1462508146) by John Teasdale et al,  which is Buddhism taken down to its bare essence with superstition removed. ""Being"" is the mode encountered during mindfulness practices, where one quiets their inner monologue and focuses only on direct experience. What is perceived is a singular omnipresent moment, and instantaneous change in this moment - past and future are not experienced. ""Doing"" is the reference frame of perceived time we're more familiar with, the mode of planning, anticipating, doing, and desiring to change. In this frame there is not a single moment but a time line consisting of infinitescimal moments, and what is exchanged is cumulative change through time.

These correlates express in our modes of thinking: analogical thinking is instantaneous parallel comparisons such as ""this _and_ that"" or ""this _like_ that."" Logical thinking is step-wise, serial, and sequential, such as ""this _therefore_ that"" and other material implications. These also correspond to visual and spacial thinking. Even the way our motion pictures work is a direction of The Tao, with watching a movie perceiving instantaneous change, while examining the sequential frames on a strip of film is cumulative over time.

""The Mindful Way Workbook"" includes the methods of perceptual derivation, and is an extraordinarily good primer on the topic. I wrote a [rough guide on some methods of perceptual integration](https://pastebin.com/vHKeTau2) where the basic mechanic is to use strong anticipation of change to induce the illusion of it, such as tactile hallucinations (""chi"") and ""visions."" The pencil technique is an easily replicable method which allows one to experience how the mechanics of perception bending work.

What is missing is a way to create real change from perceptual change, a science of praxis or Wu Wei. In 2010 after battling suicidal depression I developed a recursively self-improving self-help methodology that worked in mere weeks to totally cure my depression to such an extent that it catapulted me into extreme mania. The problem was that it worked way too well! I analyzed my psychological problem and found a paradox: there were things I needed to do want wanted to do, but I didn't do them due to learned helplessness. I treated this as a self-communication problem caused by a bunch of emotional garbage getting in the way of will and action.

The solution was to reason with myself on paper until I was 100% convinced to do something. The process I used was question -&gt; reason -&gt; action, the same as the scientific method. I started by asking questions of what my problems are, and used reason to generate a pool of options, selecting a single action to perform. I then performed the action with no resistance.

Afterwards I went back to my notebook to record my experimental observations: I had acting completely according to my will, so I logically must feel good and accomplished about myself. I used this as emotional momentum to plug it back into the process to perform another self-experiment, and another, in an unbroken chain spanning weeks. If I couldn't do something immediately, I made a cell phone timer, and eventually I began to schedule my day with more foresight.

My depression completely lifted, and I no longer needed my notebook because I had programmed this self-science method into my mind. Then meta-questions started coming, such as ""What questions should I ask to get better at asking questions?"" which is a recursively self-improving question. In my mind I had folded my self-help methodology on itself and catapulted into mania. [This is the structure that formed in my mind.](https://i.imgur.com/eGzV9rj.jpg) The scientific praxis is the same fundamentally as all praxis from artistic creativity, self-creation, biological evolution, learning- any creative system. While not alive or conscious _per se,_ creativity is an intrinsic property of matter itself.

Taoism is the true religion, Laozi had discovered calculus in its phenomenological form a thousand years before Newton. Now Eastern and Western calculus have united to create a comprehensive religious and scientific system of human experience."
taoism,Taoism and Mao Zedong,
taoism,Is life a dream?,"The other day I was in a field with two close family members having a chat under the sun. It was a beautiful spring afternoon and we were debating the idea of aliens. When all of the sudden I remembered something, I recalled that I was actually sleeping and this was all a dream. The moment I did so I looked closely at the fabric on my clothes, the feeling of the breeze running through my hair. It was all too real. But my two cousins were agreeing with me, “you should go” they said, “you’ve got a life to live.” I got a rush of excitement, a nice afternoon turned lucid dream and I began flying around like Superman. Then I woke up, in what we call “the real world.” That entire morning I spent contemplating life, is this real? The dream almost seemed more real than this. Who am I really? Why am I here? What is life? Is this like inception? A never ending cycle of dreams?

This all seems extremely philosophical but it gets good. Now I thought to myself, the only thing that remains is my consciousness. It doesn’t matter what’s real or not, I’m conscious! In my dream I was conscious and in this “reality” I’m just that, conscious! So I thought of an interesting way to look at life. By seeing life this way you banish fear, anxiety, stress and many other awful mental conditions that seem to plague our society.

Think of your life, like a dream. If you were in bed at night dreaming and you were conscious of the fact that nothing was real and you would wake up soon, would you ever be embarrassed? Could you be stressed? Would you beat yourself up for mistakes you’ve made?

The great saint in India, Muktananda, was asked, “What is real?” He replied, “What is real is that which never changes.” Your consciousness! The silent observer in the back of your head that just sees everything take place, whether it be in a dream or in what we call real life. Wayne uses the lovely example of your body, and how every cell in your body changes every 7 years. Meaning the 12 year old me was made up of completely different stuff than the now present 19 year old me. But I remain. The silent observer just witnessing everything.

That is the true self. In our culture we are taught to identify with our bodies, our career, our talents, our accomplishments. Jim Carrey calls depression “trying to keep up an image in the world.” Whether it’s a self image or a reputation with others, we try so hard to be someone we are not. If you are the car you drive, and some steals it, than you become “nobody.” If you identify with your smooth complexion than the moment wrinkles start to set in you lose your identity.

The ego is nothing but an idea in our minds of who we are and who we should be. When deep down you have a calling, a purpose to create something powerful. Regardless of how good in looks in the eyes of others. Think of life as a dream. Don’t take things so seriously. Of course there are others in this dream, they have their own purpose, there are consequences to everything. To dedicate your life to the ego will lead you down a path of disappointment and sorrow.

How do we get rid of the ego? Simple, live your life in service of others. Put your own worldly pleasure and reputation aside and do something for someone else. I will leave with this second half the peace prayer of Saint Francis.

O divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek
to be consoled as to console,
to be understood as to understand,
to be loved as to love.
For it is in giving that we receive, 
it is in pardoning that we are pardoned, 
and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.

taoism,Are we sick of Ursula Le Guin yet? More words of wisdom from one of the greatest sages of modern times...,"Do you see how an act is not, as young men think, like a rock that one picks up and throws, and it hits or misses, and that’s the end of it. When that rock is lifted, the earth is lighter; the hand that bears it heavier. When it is thrown, the circuits of the stars respond, and where it strikes or falls the universe is changed. On every act the Balance of the Whole depends. The winds and seas, the powers of water and earth and light, all that these do, and all that the beasts and green things do, is well done, and rightly done. All these act within the Equilibrium. From the hurricane and the great whale’s sounding to the fall of a dry leaf and the gnat’s flight, all they do is done within the Balance of the Whole. But we, insofar as we have power over the world and over one another, we must learn to do what the leaf and the whale and the wind do of their own nature. We must learn to keep the Balance. Having intelligence, we must not act in ignorance. Having choice, we must not act without responsibility. Who am I—though I have the power to do it—to punish and reward, playing with men’s destinies?

taoism,Hey,Hope you're having an overall peaceful day
taoism,I'm new yet familiar with Taoism,"Hi everyone. As the title says, I'm new to taking Taoism seriously but the more that I read/watch/research, the more I notice that there are many similarities with the way I grew up thinking and behaving. 

I've come from Christianity growing up, and then found my way through a plethora of religions and belief systems. Everything from Shinto and Judaidm to Satanism and Atheism. 

Thanks to @georgethuk posting a video with SerpentZA (YouTuber) I've found a direct connection. 

I bought a nice edition of the Tao Te Ching early 2017 from Books a million and have loved reading it and learning from it, but I didn't go much further. Until now. Even my wife is interested and said today that she sees Taoism to be for her personally. That says a lot because she doesn't really hold to many or any belief systems or ways of life. 

Anyways, thanks for reading and I love learning from your posts. Thanks to SerpentZA whom I followed on YouTube for sharing about George so the next step could be taken. 
Btw George. Master Gu and his family as well as school are incredible. 

I'd love anyone's feedback or comments. "

taoism,20 year mystery? Does this mean anything?,"About 20 years ago I had an ""episode"" that lasted for about 5 hours where I (apparently) spoke and sang in different languages other than my own native American English.


At the time I was a Pentecostal Christian. In that religion there is a common place thing called ""speaking in tongues"" where an adherent speaks in heavenly languages. At the time I assumed that that is what had happened. 20 years later I am currently an agnostic atheist and have dismissed this episode as a natural phenomena that I can't understand.


There is one phrase that always stuck out to me from that day. It sounds Chinese to me.


The way it sounds phonetically in English is ""Sing Con Dow"". 


I only learned a year ago that Tao is pronounced dow. I made that connection to the sound from the phrase and it made me curious. The best I can find is, if the phrase wasn't gibberish, and was Chinese it would be ""Tsing (con) Tao"". I just don't know how to find a Chinese word for the ""con"" sound.

taoism,Cosmic body vs Personal body,"Hello everyone, I found this rather interesting post from a [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/laozhuangdaoism/posts/961071560724420) I follow, and would like to share it with you all. It is about the Cosmic body and the emphasis on Mind in Daoism:
_______________________
&gt;For many mystical thinkers, the body does not play an important role. Zhuangzi [Chuang Tzu] and Guo Xiang [Kuo Hsiang] and the mystics writing under the impact of Buddhism are concerned primarily with the mind, and exert much effort to describe its exact functioning. The most radical denial of the body is found in the Xisheng jing [Hsi-sheng Ching], which clearly denounces all attemps to nourish the body in the search for mystical union. 'The untrue Tao [Dao] teaches you to nourish the body, the true Tao teaches you to nourish the spirit' (7.4), it says, and emphasizes that 'the body ultimately is mere dust and ashes' (7.7). Yet even the Xisheng jing makes a distinction between the body as a cosmic power and the body as personal identity.
The physical cosmic body is part of creation; it merges with the spirit to realize the Tao. The cosmic body belongs to the universal, yet it can only be nourished through concentration and visualization of the spirits residing in it. The personal body, on the other hand, is the product of the senses; it is is an imaginary self built through discriminating consciousness and passions and desires. It is the source of all trouble, sorrow and afflictions. The personal body must be abandoned, silenced, eradicated in favour of the cosmic body cultivated through the spirit. Only in a state of no-self, free from constructed identity, can the Tao and the spirit flourish. This, in turn, leads to long life and thus has a positive effect on the physical body. When this body returns to dust and ashes, the spirit immortal ascends into heaven.
This vision of the Xisheng jing goes back to two earlier and more straightforward concepts of body and mind. One, in the lineage of the Daode jing [Tao-te Ching], sees the body as the natural state of humanity and physical being as the naturalness of the Tao. The other, part of the immortality belief, understands the body as a replica of the universe, which includes all the stars and gods and heavens (see 'Taoist Visions of Body', by Livia Kohn, in the Journal of Chinese Philosophy, 18.3).
When the body is the naturalness of the Tao, the mystical process is a return, a recovery of physical spontaneity [tzu-jan]. Abstention from conscious action and willful thinking is the method that leads there. The practice consists of cultivating quietude and tranquillity; it is a withdrawal from the world and into oneself that easiliy accommodates the physical therapies of the medical tradition. Its aim is an enstatic withdrawal into oneself, a complete natural simplicity in life and mind.
When the body is a replica of the universe, the mystical quest is the discovery of the universe within, a process that simultaneously takes the seeker to the far ends of the world outside and into the heavens. True realization of oneself as a physical being occurs in the identification of one's body with the cosmos at large. The practice consists of visualizations and shamanic flights. The movement goes outward and away from all; it is an ecstatic exploration of the cosmos. ~ from Early Chinese Mysticism - Philosophy and Soteriology in the Taoist Tradition, by Livia Kohn, Princeton 1992, p.170-171)

taoism,The Big Draw,"Hey people.
Can someone describe the big draw method to me? I hear people who practices it everyday, and I want to do that as well, but from what I understand, you can only do it while having sexual intercourse or practicing it during masturbation. So if I want to practice this, do I have to masturbate everyday?

In some books it sounds like it's more like a breathing exercise from a correct lying/sitting/standing position. I need to incorporate some of these daily taoist exercises, right now I only do the kegel exercises."
taoism,Loneliness?,"Does the Tao Te Ching/Chuangzi have a solution to loneliness/feeling lonely?

I’m generally a pretty darn happy person and taoism is something that keeps me that way. It’s what made me that way. Except, I get these weird moments sometimes in the day, usually st night though, of loneliness and sadness. It can last briefly then I go back to being happy, or it can last longer and I fall asleep like it. Any advice or help? "
taoism,Are there Taoist monastaries?,"I've been a Taoist for many years. I'm 23. The Tao Te Ching has gotten me through the toughest parts of my life. It is firmly what I believe, cosmologically and philosophically. But I find myself slipping up a lot. I frequently find myself pursuing selfish desires and getting angry. 

I've spent a long time struggling to find the line between selflessness and selfishness, forgiveness and justice, etc. It's becoming clear to me that when I'm done with the National Guard I don't have much planned. I don't really want to do much besides spend some time in Korea. I know Taoism is kind of marginalized in Korea, so I doubt there's any kind of monastery there. But are there any at all? I genuinely want to get away and get closer to the Tao, and I think having that kind of strict lifestyle will help.

Edit: so there's White Cloud Temple. Does anyone know what it would take to join? Do you have to be a Chinese citizen to live at a temple, or are you protected on religious grounds?"

taoism,My story. (Need help) + hair length.,"
First of all I just want to say I am agnostic, I believe in a Creator and that there is some type of intelligence or God that looks out after us and I have experienced it. However that being said, I have been going through a lot of what some might call probable imbalances in the past year or so that I haven't really figured out.

I've only read that energy and hair length coincide on a spiritual level from Indian philosophy not so much Qui-Gon. Everything I say in this story is true and not fabricated.
 
 3 years ago I begin to meditate heavily, roughly 2 hours every morning for about 6 months. In that time I was growing my hair long. Hair became down to shoulder length. Occasionally visualize something like in my mind that I wanted but not much came from that sort of practice. With the two hours of meditation every morning I became very disassociated and begin to will a barrier between me and the general population that seem to only be mitigated by going near open areas.
 
 Going to the ocean, going to an abandoned Park, hiking trail 2 miles on the outskirts of society. Eventually two miles turned into 30 miles and then into 40 miles and these trips were becoming a longer and longer. I was a hardcore meditator and was practicing celibacy, I still practice celibacy but in terms of meditation

I remember trying to meditate in an apartment one morning and I could not get into my state. I then found myself compelled to drive 40 miles into the Wilderness inland of California to escape a strange feeling. Everything in me was compelled to be at one with nature. In fact every time I meditated that feeling would hit me immediately within 20 minutes and I would have to be out in the open or in a field and I was becoming increasingly disconnected and disassociated with Society. So I dropped meditation.
 
 I continued celibacy but my hair length through and I still had a Detachment from society. There is an Indian religion and I've only found one page speaks of hair lengths role in energy and how it functions. As my hair was long I was able to pick up a job doing emergency roadside assistance, probably through my own prayer. Interesting Lee at that company there were two men that work there who had long dreadlocks so that probably was a moment of synchronicity.
 
 As for me, every few weeks into celibacy I always had to gather energy from nature. It was a requirement of my body to move on the outskirts of society and absorb energy. I-Ready page about hair and its relation to the spirit and vibrations in a man, and how long hair in a man can produce vibrations of irritability and imbalance if one is not careful and live a very aesthetic life. (Sp) - 
 
 So for about 3 years I got very good at understanding myself with long hair and for three years every two or three weeks I would take a trip on the outskirts of town either by a trail, or down the road by the rocks, or sometimes depending on my thoughts and energy level I would drive way out of town. Meditation also open me up to cosmic energy and I would feel the energy of certain places especially wide open valleys, or certain hiking trails with the trees, almost as if the very piece of nature would be absorbed into my entire being.
 
 There are certain places I can drive right now, and I would feel a lightness of my head, and energy flow through my body and my bones and my mood would change. Nature was forcing me to certain places.
 
 It is true that the hair acts as a covering and protection of the mine on an energetic level. People tend to keep their distance and my gauge is averted to most people in my town I'm assuming based upon hair length. Many people would say this is just false beliefs and putting out there but in truth I have experienced it.
 
 Then I cut my hair.
 
 A week later I was driving down the road and I felt significant waves of energy trying to well let's just say I don't really want to talk about it,. But I cut about two feet length of hair and that really trimmed my aura. I was exposed to everything energetically and I noticed people would approach me more or I felt naked as I drove down the road. I also began to have telepathic experiences over the phone picking up people's energy through the phone. If I sat outside the sunlight in the entire Spear of my aura would expand and things would happen.
 
 I would see the sky turn a very light blue in the sun would begin to radiate very hot. If clouds were there they would melt away and hummingbirds, butterflies, and exotic type things would happen. Certain breathing exercises such as bringing the chi up and expanding out to my crown would cause effects in the environment. This sounds pretty strange and I know people won't believe me, but at times I'd be able to make people leave my area.
 
 See, having thick layers of hair covering my head acted as a covering to the spiritual Aura and energies I was connected to. And I was not ready for everything that happened and really thought I was losing my mind. Sometimes, and this sounds funny and I know people are going to think this is odd, but if I were to meditate or release certain Chi and certain populated areas, these attractive beautiful girls would start to hover around me or be near me. Or synchronicities would happen like, if I pushed hard on my exhaled hard and released Chi out of my crown chakra I would start syncing up with people in a crowd.
 
 Like a man would be walking and then all of a sudden in front of me we would be taking the exact same steps looking at the same places Etc. Different Miracles were happening to at that time, I had distant relatives get in touch with me to reconnect and people that had moved away wanted to be around me all the time but at the same time I was dealing with the world in a strange way constantly feeling the connection to the Divine always opening and closing and I didn't know how to manage it.
 
 All it took was 2 minutes of meditation and that portal would open up again so to speak. Well one day I got tired of dealing with all of it so I decided to just jump right back into meditation and basically everything just started completely over and then I just dropped.

Practicing celibacy, I'm not always celibate I have a girl friend over the past couple years, but all those hours of meditation and the long hair definitely opened up channels I should say, but also quitting alcohol and practicing celibacy, and then living a hermetic Lifestyle by trying to quit the internet really drastically change things last year. Constantly trying to refine myself.

Hair definitely is a factor in the spiritual realm in a sense that, for some reason I had so much sensitivity that when I finally cut my hair it was like cutting down a thick barrier of protection and thus all of the crazy stuff that happened. To this day I couldn't say how it happened, but I know that if I were to go outside in meditate people would feel things but I try I stopped meditating and I don't want that stuff to happen anymore.

, for me to say that I was able to manipulate clouds could either be someone's subjective crazy talk or you would just have to take my word for it. I used to go to this spot I would always walk on a trail and send chi in a Direction. When it was done and trust me, I have done this probably 300 * after discovering it, I nearly fall down because she Rises up to the head correct? After looking I would notice the clouds would be changed or manipulated.

Truly the only thing that has saved me was declaring faith in a Creator and a God to save me and also prayer, and having faith that there is a Creator there. And understanding that whatever gift that I had or went through it's still there and it is still dormant, as I have grown my hair out long again. But because my hair is long I noticed my energy shifts and I am drawn back to the forest and back out on the outskirts of society, but it is not only and not too many people want to be. But the air is an antenna to the divine as it is written if you Google it.

My point in all this? Well I don't really know. I do know that cutting your hair as a man will actually probably sensitize and enhance your Energies. I noticed that my energy was more welcome in public places. Generally I have an anxiety of about five or six in public places around my town. When I cut my hair my anxiety was about 0 or 1 I was more welcome to my energy was more welcome. However I had lost the ability to pick up vibrations from nature after cutting my hair.
 
 My best description is, if a man looks like a tree, he becomes the tree. LOL. What I'm writing is just general help on how to not feel all of these strange ups and downs now that my hair's getting longer I still tend to feel I suppose it would be cheesy or energy not really moving or just feeling very restless.
 
 I remember when my hair was short come up I actually had more energy and felt younger. Literally I was able to run through my town, this was just last year, I grabbed onto one of those shopping cart holders and flipped on it. What the band roach in the Indian philosophy article was true. A man with long hair attracts different energies sometimes it can slow you down. For instance when I was out in the wilderness it took a long time to pick up energy so that I can feel balanced again. But when I come back home it starts. There's many more I can talk about but I think I'll end on that note all feedback is appreciated. Thank you for reading"
taoism,"Wu Wei: Ancient Secrets to Spontaneous &amp; Effortless Living | Tea Time Taoism - (feat. ""acting"" from Master Gu and I...)",
taoism,Wu Wei vs. Pushing yourself and being disciplined.,"Hey guys! Lovely sub. I'm a newcomer.

The concept of wu wei is something that I surely resonate with a lot as I can remember many times in my own life where I have messed things up by forcing things and being too attached. I can also remember things unfolding with ease in situations where I have been more easygoing.
At the same time I am believer in having direction and putting in effort and discipline in life to become the best version of yourself. In my life I have to put in effort and sometimes force to make myself do the things I need to do to drive my self in the right direction.
What is your take on this matter? How do we balance the two aspects if at all?"
taoism,Afraid of the Tao?,"I also posted something like this on /r/buddhism and I know the traditions are different, but I sometimes encounter something like panic and a fear of the dao itself, in part because of the negative side of it and an awareness of how scary it can be to approach the dao the wrong way. How can I meet the dao with peace and acceptance?  "
taoism,Zuowang - Wikipedia,
taoism,Predestination,"Were you going to reply to this the way you did, no matter what you thought and felt about it?"
taoism,Two kinds of Dao in Laozi.,"It seems to me that there are two kinds of Dao in the *Lao Zi* (not including ""dao"" as a verb in the opening line of ch.1). #1 is the sum of all natural principles; #2 is the morality that we can derive from those natural principles.

Here's my evidence:

1. Dao as natural principles: LZ ch.25 (Lau): ""Man models himself on earth, Earth on heaven, Heaven on the way, And the way on that which is naturally so.” See also chs.34, 42.

2. Dao as morality extrapolated from those natural principles: LZ ch.18 (Lau): ""When the great way falls into disuse / There are benevolence and rectitude."" Thus, we can apparently choose to not use it. Also LZ ch.21 (Lau): ""In his every movement a man of great virtue / Follows the way and the way only."" On the negative side, ch.30 (Lau): ""A creature in its prime doing harm to the old / Is known as going against the way. That which goes against the way will come to an early end.” And ch.38 (Lau): ""Hence when the way was lost there was virtue."" See also chs.9, 14, 24, 31, 41, 46,53, 55, 65, 77. 

Bonus #3: Dao as semi-anthropomorphic entity: LZ ch.23 (Lau): ""He who conforms to the way is gladly accepted by the way."" If the Way can be ""glad"" then that's anthropomorphism. (I would take this to be a literary device, but for literal minded folks, this is evidence that the Dao, insofar as it can be glad, is conscious.)

So I guess my two questions are: 1. Do you know of anyone else who has said that there are two kinds of Dao in the LZ? And 2. If you disagree with my analysis, why?"
taoism,Question sorta or thoughts.,"How is it sustainable to follow Taoism in the modern day western world? It seems like the ideology that Taoist try to strive for would be extremely difficult to follow. I mean our whole society is based around what Taoism is against, desire. Without the drive to continue to “win” or become more successful you need to strive to maintain your home, property, car, insurance, etc. although I really am interested in following Taoism, but I feel like you could never reach the end goal because the current way society and government is built; it’s not possible. Unless you live of the grid I guess."
taoism,Four sources of morality in Laozi.,"It seems to me that there are four sources of morality in the *Laozi*: people, sages, oneself, and the Way. How do we know when to follow which?

1. People: LZ ch.49 (Lau trans.): ""The sage has no mind of his own. He takes as his own the mind of the people.""

2. Sages: Sages are held up as people to emulate in chs.2, 3, 7, 22, 26-29, 47, 57, 58, 60, 63, 64, 66, 71-73, 77-79, and 81.

3. Oneself: ch.38 (Lau): ""A man of the highest virtue does not keep to virtue and that is why he has virtue."" I take this to mean that a man of the highest virtue does not keep to traditional notions of virtue (i.e., cultural norms set by the people and sages). Also LZ ch.48 (Lau): ""In the pursuit of learning one knows more every day; in the pursuit of the way one does less every day."" I take this to mean that we should reevaluate traditional wisdom and morality based on our own experience.

4. The Way: ch.14 (Lau): ""Hold fast to the way of antiquity, In order to keep in control the realm of today."" Ch.21 (Lau): ""In his every movement a man of great virtue / Follows the way and the way only.""

So, to repeat my question: how do we know which to follow? I suppose the answer is ""sometimes one, sometimes another"" but how to know when to follow which?

Bonus question: since the Way does not speak, how do we know what it would ""want"" us to do in any given situation?"
taoism,Non Resistance / Interference,"As I continue to read Taoist blogs, watch Taoism themed videos, and listen to podcasts I always stumble across these concepts. Those being, Non-Resistance or Non-Interference. It's seems that these ideas are a crucial part to someone wanting to cultivate a state of wu-wei or ""not deliberately going against the grain of things"" as Alan Watts put in a lecture. Albeit intentional wu-wei is not wu-wei. Anyway, I digress, my question is: would going out of my way (creating strain and resistancing things) to stop something bad from happing to me or someone else be considered ""going against the flow, or gain of things""? Can one interfere and still be flowing with the current of life, rather than against?

To wander free among the mountains,

and a good strong vine helps when it’s steeper.

The pines beside the creeks are always green,

You might get cut off from all your friends,

taoism,Benevolence in Chuang Tzu,"I'm halfway thru reading Chuang Tzu for the first time, and I feel like I am missing some context around the term ""benevolence"". It seems that he is reacting to a specific teaching prevalent at the time (possibly from Confucius?) that everyone should practice benevolence, but I think that there is a much more specific meaning intended than the one I'm familiar with. What's really going on here in the text?

On a possibly-related note, I'm somewhat confused that Confucius sometimes appears as a character who has good things to say, while at other times his teachings are mocked and decried against. Am I misunderstanding this? It's possible there is some sarcasm or subtlety lost on me and that the character of Confucius in Chuang Tzu is not meant to be seen in a good light at all?"
taoism,Can manners imply a lack of virtue?,"Where I live people are quite often very polite and would typically view the directness that a Taoist would have as rude or inconsiderate but it might just be the opposite both ways. In reality there are a lot of internal problems between friends and families here yet everyone is so polite. It really got me thinking whether a lot of of this outwardly kindness implies a lack of virtue more than anything, the more of the former, the less of the latter. Do manners like saying please and thank you, excuse me or smiling to be polite imply a lack of virtue to an extent?"
taoism,The path of least resistance,"I was reading the ""Buddhist boot camp"" book and this paragraph made me think:

""before making any decision, ask yourself: Will this action that I am considering get me closer to the kind of life I want to live, or farther from it? The key, again is to think of the far-reaching consequences of your decisions, not just instant gratification. Here's the catch: the path of LEAST resistance will often take you farther from your destination than the seemingly more difficult one, but an easy trek in the wrong direction is ultimately far more exhausting and devastating than an uphill climb toward euphoria.""

Is this not in direct opposition to the concept of `wu wei`? 

Is this the place where Buddhism and Taoism clearly differ or did I or the author misunderstand something?

One example I have in mind here is eating unhealthy food - in a long term this may be unnatural and cause us to feel bad and shorten our lives, so we want to eat healthy instead. On the other hand, we can feel the urge to eat it right now and it is very strong. It seems to me that the path of least resistance would be to give in and eat, while a more difficult path of not letting the desire take over, would be to resist the urge. What do you think?"

taoism,Meditation Diary,"Hi, fellow Dao-Cultivators,

many of you do meditate as I do too. I thought about writing a journal about my meditations. I want to write down how the meditation went and how long I meditated but - and this is what I like to talk about -  also about the thoughts which came up during meditation, maybe even more than once.

The idea is that thoughts coming up have a meaning and writing them down afterward enables me to remember them and I can see patterns and formulate actions to calm my mind.

Let's take a cliché example: At every meditation, thoughts come up bout talking to a girl and my mind cannot be calm. I write it down and see that my mind is burdened with thinking about her every day. 

Seeing this and being conscious of it I could formulate an action: Talk to her. The result, positive or negative, would calm my mind.

I imagine this could work for many other issues and situations in life too. What do you think, have you done this in the past, is it a good idea? Where there any problems?

Thank you for your time!

taoism,"Question about ""The Named"" (TTC Chapter 1)","Hello, I want to ask about a specific line from Chapter 1 of the Tao Te Ching. The line is the ""fourth"" line : The named is the mother of myriad things. This is just one translation, and here I've taken it out of context with the rest of the translation.  
  
The full context of the translation:  
The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao
The name that can be named is not the eternal name
The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth
The named is the mother of myriad things  
  
I'm not married to this translation, it's just the first one I came across. If there is another translation you think points to the underlying idea of Line 4, then please use that.  
  
I've been wracking my brain trying to figure out how to best phrase this question. Basic idea is, what is The Named being mentioned here? Is it, in english, closer to a noun or a verb? I feel like you can read it one way as the ""act of naming"" is the Mother of all things, or read it another way that there is a named Tao that is the Mother of all things. In the context of the lines before it almost makes it sound like it's talking about 2 Tao's, but even that reading depends greatly on your translation. I've been recently exploring the idea that it's more describing 2 dual aspects of the 1 Tao.  
  
Does anyone have any insight or any interpretations they'd like to share about the line,
'The named is the mother of myriad things'  
from whatever translation you prefer, with the context of that translation? Who or what is the Named? Is it even a who or a what?"

taoism,What is your impression of Hsin Hsin Ming?,"Hello! 

I am fond of Hsin Hsin Mings verses of faith-mind.

I believe that this is more of a zen writing, but I have always read it as almost a daoist text, it seems closely related. 

What do you think of it?

taoism,Purity of mind (alan watts),"Great insight from The way of zen by Watts;

Hui-neng’s position was that a man with an empty consciousness was no better than “a block of wood or a lump of stone.” 
He insisted that the whole idea of purifying the mind was irrelevant
and confusing, because “our own nature is fundamentally clear and
pure.” In other words, there is no analogy between consciousness or mind and a mirror that can be wiped. The true 
mind is “no-mind”(wu-hsin), which is to say that it is not to be regarded as an object
of thought or action, as if it were a thing to be grasped and controlled. 

The attempt to work on one’s own mind is a vicious
circle. To try to purify it is to be contaminated with purity.
Obviously this is the Taoist philosophy of naturalness, according to which a person is not genuinely free, detached, or pure when his state is the result of an arti+cial discipline. He is just imitating
purity, just “faking” clear awareness. Hence the unpleasant selfrighteousness
of those who are deliberately and methodically
religious.

Hui-neng’s teaching is that instead of trying to purify or empty
the mind, one must simply let go of the mind–because the mind is
nothing to be grasped. Letting go of the mind is also equivalent to
letting go of the series of thoughts and impressions (nien) which
come and go “in” the mind, neither repressing them, holding them,
nor interfering with them.


This might be why I personally have never been 100% into Buddhist method of mind clearing"
taoism,Question regarding undesired tasks,"How does wu wei works with this type of tasks? Like for example, that day when you wake up and dont want to work (example) or going to a familiar celebration. That situations which you need to squarrel to go through them. Is that striving wu wei? (Because the task needs to be completed)"

taoism,"A thought: The branches that oppose the most resistance to the wind are the first one to break, if this wouldn’t happen it would be the tree itself what would break.","I was meditating and watching  the strong winds  hit the 60 foot tall  trees and break several branches: first the small and dry ones, which seemed to be necessary for the tree to get rid of, then healthy medium and large branches the size of a small tree were being stripped away from the tree. At first I thought it was unfair  that the poor old tree had be a victim of the wind and lose years of growth. Then I asked my self why and the tree “answered me” (I don’t really think plants talk but I like putting it that way) : —those branches that break are the ones that opposed the most resistance to the wind; these other branches that stay strong, are strong because they are more flexible and their position and shape go with the flow of the wind. If no branches were to break, I would break in half or get totally  rooted out.

There I understood the bad and the good of the breaking branches. There I realized that in our life sometimes we have to let go some of our branches, regardless of how much time and painful it is , when the resistance against the winds of our life  is too strong. If we don’t, if we attach to it relentlessly, we might end up breaking our core of our life.  

That is a glimpse I had about the path of the least resistance.

taoism,Does anyone have an mp3 link for Alan watts 4 hour lecture? Or others?,I've recently been listening to small portions of taoism lectures on the way to work via MP3 is that I've downloaded from YouTube. I've been listening to him talk about the Tao and Buddhism and I really want to listen to the entire for hour lecture but the site that I use to get these MP3 is cannot convert that long of a video. Does anybody have the full lecture of taoism available somewhere as a link or something I can put on my phone? I know it's very unlikely since this is not the Buddhists subreddit Brittany files on Buddhism are appreciated as well since I'm studying both for the time being to find which one is truly me.

taoism,The student asked: “Why be like water?”,"The sage replied:

Water is an embodiment of the Tao

Unassuming, flowing, and free

To be like water is to be like the Tao

To be like the Tao is to be like the world

Thus the Tao is your origin, where the water of life flows

An ancient sage once said:

Return to your origin

For your origin is your peace"
