Buddhism,Radical Acceptance- Embracing your life with the heart of Buddha,"I’ve just finished this book and it’s really helped me with accepting life as is and the whole concept of impermanence. I have always struggled with the need to control my life and I do not know how to let go even when I know I have to. 

Since I started reading this book I’ve had a recurring dream. In the dream I am watching a person recite something I originally thought was a prayer but it eventually came together as a poem.  Every dream had a piece of the poem so I pieced it together as best I could. 

The dream is hard to have because this person was dear to me and is no longer in my life. I’m hoping now that the poem feels complete the dream will no longer occur. 

Thank you for letting me share. 


Let the light shine through you.   
Be open to receive it. Open your heart and soul to let it in.     
Embrace that light in all of who you are.             
But as well as you embrace it and take it in, make sure you let it go.              
Let it pass through you because that is what this life is about.           
It is about taking it in, feeling it and moving it through you.         
Because you let it go doesn’t mean you can’t still feel it’s warmth and shine.          
It doesn’t mean that the love is lost or that your soul isn’t still imprinted on mine.         
Feel it when you need it but don’t hold on, you must let go.          
As you let the light shine through you, I will do the same for me.         
I will feel the light, I will take it in because just like you I need it.         
I need it to fill my heart and soul because at times it feels dark.        
But as I take the light in and it passes through me I release a little bit of the darkness.       
We can’t feel the light together, we can’t share what the light is doing nor can we encourage each other to be open.       
But just because we can’t experience it together doesn’t mean we shut it out.         
So please remember to always let the light in and trust that I will do the same forever.

Buddhism,I doubted the Dharma.,"I am a relatively new practitioner; I've been practicing for about 2 years now. But contrary to many people new to Buddhism, I have been practicing within the cloister of a Zen Monastery for the entirety of that time. The practice here is intense.. I've done more than 20 week long sesshins, a number of zazenkais and I am a formal student of the order. The growth and maturity I've experience these past two years have been immeasurable and so valuable..

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I truly doubted the practice for the first time.

&amp;#x200B;

I've felt a strong calling towards Monasticism for a large part of my life, even early in my life when I did not have a real relationship to Buddhism. It's something that I've truly believed would be a life worth living, looking deeply into the reality of things and offering my life in service of others seeking the path. Excluding the details of the events that played a part in my doubt, I've begun questioning if dedicating my life entirely to the three Treasures is actually worth it. ( I really did not want to use the word ""worth"" but I am lacking a better way to articulate ).

&amp;#x200B;

I am at this pivotal point in my practice where the way I've been practicing isn't necessarily working anymore. And its not because I've been practicing ""wrong"" or half-ass; Its just that on a fundamental level, I've been doing things the way I always have.  That the progress I've been experiencing is really just the entry into the deep well of Buddha-Dharma, and a deeper shift in the way I interact and relate to my experience needs to unfold.

&amp;#x200B;

I've doubted if this is actually real.. If its actually worth the struggle and work. Which is crazy to consider because it completely has been up to this point. But like.. am I just fooling myself..? Is this just some kind of brainwash.. How deep does this really go.. Am I tricking myself into detaching from the narrative of things and just experiencing directly.. In the beginning of my sitting practice I totally was repressing for sometime but now  I am very aware (at least on the level I am) of when I am repressing or legitimately letting go. But what is experiencing directly exactly? What does that look like in relative reality.. How is the absolute relative, and relative the absolute..

&amp;#x200B;

This was a very emotional experience. I was sobbing in the middle of the zendo ( again =p ).. But in the bottom of my heart I felt the Dharma was real, it is true. But my mind still wants to doubt it.. Oh Mara

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I am just rambling now but my whole idea of what being a realized being is, what enlightenment is, of what practice is has been shaken. Which is really a healthy thing, I know that my idea of what these things are, is not the reality of them but still... Is it worth giving up the world to dive deeply into this...

&amp;#x200B;"
Buddhism,"I am extremely depressed, greedy, lonely, lustful, resentful. Is there anyone like me who has been cured through Buddhism?","I have been hurting lately. I hurt because of the things that I don't have. I feel alone. No friends or girlfriend. Socially stunted and isolated. Unable to connect with others. Avoidance of social situations. Extreme resentment of certain people. 

I hurt so I find means of escapism. Marijuana. Social Media. Porn. Video games. Escorts. These things make me feel happy for a short time, only to feel even worse later on. 

Buddhism is appealing, because buddhism tells me that I'm just sick and crazy but I can be cured if I follow the path.

I have a hard time finding the discipline to follow the path. I have a hard time meditating, even if it's just keeping a commitment of a couple minutes a day. I have a hard time feeling altruistic towards others. I don't even feel compassion towards myself. I don't ever feel like giving my hard earned money to others, I feel too attached to it. I have a hard time connecting with the more dogmatic aspects of buddhism, in fact it kind of leaves a bad taste because I've never been a big fan of religion. 

But I'm desperate, and I always come back to idealizing buddhism. I always keep thinking that this will how I could end my suffering.

Has anyone been like me, and was cured by buddhism?"
Buddhism,TIL: there is a german matchmaking agency where 47% of the members relate to buddhism,"So i want to find new friends an a new love. searching the internet for help i stumbled over this dating agency that has a very strong focuss on taking into account specialities and quirks of the members, like disabilities, eating habbits, unusual family planning, relegious believes and whatnot.

what i find most interesting is that among the users of this agency 47% say they are interested in or study buddhism, with christianiy ranking second at 39% (though both can be selected at the same time). it is especially noteworthy because germany, with a population of roughly 80 millions, has only an estimated 250.000 active buddhists.

another interesting thing about this site is the pricing model. the normal price is 94€ per year, but anyone can pick a reduced rate for people with low income at 69€.  however, they also offer membership at 6€! per year, if one writes an email to the administrators and explains that one is so poor that the reduced rate still can not be afforded.

now, you might think: eh, to special, to small, wont work. but: its actually not that small  with 19000 active members, and it has a comparably very high success rate.

i just wanted to share this with you, because i think its a great thing to  know about and because it might help someone else looking for the same things i do.

i am unsure if i should write out the name of the agency here. i do not want to appear as if i would want to do a promotion for this service. if you are interested, just ask within the comments and i will tell you the name.

Buddhism,Why was Gautama Buddha reluctant to ordain women?,"Did he try to limit the influence of desire inside his sangha? Was it because the first of his disciples were men, and were it otherwise (he would have started teaching women first), he would be reluctant to ordain men the same way?

&amp;#x200B;

If enlightenment provides one with limitless wisdom, couldn't he have found a way right there and then, to counter this problem?

If he was reluctant, he must have had some idea of why that is. Some doubts about positive outcome. Does that mean attaining Nirvana does not directly correlate to being doubt-free?"

Buddhism,How to practice Buddhism?,"Hello all,

I am new to Buddhism. After growing up catholic and being anti-religion for years I decided to embrace my spiritual side that was always there. I made the recognition religion and spirituality are separate things. 

Then I started learning about Buddhism, the four noble truths and eightfold path. I learned of the history of the Buddha. I agree with everything I am learning. My question is, how do I actually practice Buddhism? 

I currently meditate a few times a week (although short still I haven’t been able to transcend deep into meditating because sitting for ten minutes is still hard for me.)

I do yoga a few times a week as well. But there is more to it than that. I live in one of the biggest cities In The country and there are temples near me, but honestly it’s intimidating.

The closest one to my house is Vietnamese and I haven’t actually gone but their website has all these words I don’t know, haha I know it sounds dumb. But it’s like entering a whole new culture I know nothing about. Like what’s a Abidhamma class? What’s a weekly Dhamma  Deshana? Daily Buddha Puja? Lol 
I’m white and I don’t really fit in with this culture, but it’s interesting to me.

I’ve also gone to a couple of meditation meetups but they’ve been... odd to say the least.  One of the meetups had huge roaches on the walls and I absolutely could not relax to meditate, lol. 

I guess I just need to keep searching? Or get brave enough to go to a temple. 

Anyone have anything they can share about their practice in Buddhism? Anything you do, anywhere you go? Any good books to read?


Thank  you!!!"
Buddhism,Pleasure,Buddhism talks an awful lot about suffering. What does it teach about pleasure?
Buddhism,Nowhere to go,"Hello r/Buddhism. When I was in my teens I was fueled by worldly attractions (power, money, lust etc.). Needless to say this never led me to fulfillment however I still was moving around jobs and felt like I was getting somewhere. Then my trip turned towards the spiritual side of things. I have been reading tons, listening to lectures, and meditating daily. I'd even go on bursts of exercising and eating healthy. I was feeling better bit by bit. Recently I had a realization that there is nothing 'I' can do to get rid of 'myself'. Great right this is a great mystical realization. Wrong. I have no motivation to go anywhere anymore there's no goodie out there for 'me' to get. Yet the identification to the mind still persists. I'm lost and tired with no where to go."
Buddhism,Need advice please,"I have become deeply disturbed by the suffering that exists in the world and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

(Quick background) I grew up very religious in the Christian faith. I no longer subscribe to any religion, but I find Buddhism a million times more humanistic and a much better philosophy towards life than Christianity.

&amp;#x200B;

I no longer know whether or not a god exists, but if one does, I am deeply saddened by the amount of animal/human suffering in the world and the lack of any intervention by any possible god. So either there is no god or there is a god, but they do not care/intervene in anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I need help with is this:

How do I cope knowing there is so much suffering in the world?

How can I stay happy and positive when some person or some animal is suffering?

What can I personally do to alleviate suffering?

If there is a god, why do they allow this to happen?

&amp;#x200B;

How could a god allow things like the holocaust or wild animal suffering/torture by other humans?"
Buddhism,How to chant?,"What I do — I have been chanting early in the morning after waking up for about 60-75 minutes before I meditate. It’s either the last portion of the Hridaya Sutra or Om Mani Padme Hum. 

Why I do it — I understand the meaning of the words and constant repetition helps reaffirm my motivation and also sharpen my focus.

The doubt — I came across a passage from the Ghitassara Sutta where the Buddha explains the 5 drawbacks of reciting with a musical intonation. I have, over the days, settled into a particular way of recital and am wondering what I should do about it. Should I give up chanting?"
Buddhism,Saying from Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche,"In this age of materialism, people suffer from alienation and lack of purpose, and many people are seeking for something more. When there is so much seeking, there is a danger that a path specially designed to relieve temporal pain might come to overshadow the real path that uproots suffering, the true path to enlightenment.

Interest in dharma is scarce to begin with, and even then, such interest is very fickle. And if we were to encounter a path that did not have the view, we would become even more disillusioned. This would be very sad, because there is genuine seeking. Without the view, the whole purpose of Buddhism is lost. It is then no longer Buddhism – a path to enlightenment – but merely a method for temporal healing.

So, even for the sake of insurance, at least some of us should pay some attention to establishing the view.

Buddhism,Question about a monk who goes by Cau Chin (uncle 9),"   
Long post saying sorry ahead of time


Hello, I recently got into Buddhism.  From 29 til now I have been going through such a rough time in my life.  I have no direction in life.  No solid career to help me support my 2 sons (6 and 4).  I am a single father and was devastated when my ex left us for another man.  I was a wreck for a good 6 months.  I found peace through Buddhist teaching and through the peace I was slowly able to get my life on track.

  I started to work at a company with fellow Vietnamese people that are Buddhist.  I took the Buddhist teaching serious I even became a vegetarian to prove my faith.  Anywho, a coworker of mine referred me to see Cau Chin a famous monk in Houston TX.    After work last Monday I went to go see him with a coworker.  He’s famous for his fortune telling (coi boi).  I don’t believe in fortune telling.  I decided to go anyways to see the temple.  To my surprise it is a beautiful temple with a lot of ethnicity.  Mexican, blacks, Asians, white, etc.

I walked into the temple as there were people in attendance and Cau Chin was doing his Buddhist chants (sorry if it’s not a chant I’m fairly new to Buddhism).  After he finished he walked into the room and I walked to  Quan  The Am Bo Tat statue to show my respects.  Got on my knees and bowed down 2 times I was suppose to do 3.  As I was about to bow down for the third time I felt someone tap my right shoulder and ask me in Vietnamese “what is your sign) I was confused because when Vietnamese people see me they think I’m Filipino or Mexican 99% of the time.  So he repeated himself as I looked confused and I told him in Vietnamese “dragon” he said “88, this is a tough year for you and every step you take forward you take 3 step back.  You’re sad and have no direction in life.  Soon it will all work out as long as you keep faith in Buddha.”  He goes on to tell me that I will find love soon so don’t be sad.  Then tells me my ages that I will have good luck.  He talks really fast.  I should have listened to advice from others and record him talking because he talks fast.  


Mind you I have never looked at this man or had eye contact with him.  He hasn’t even looked my way until he saw me bowing down to the Buddha statue.  I don’t know how he saw sadness and struggle from me.  I tend to keep my feelings inside and show no facial expression.  I normally smile and talkative at work.  The last instruction he gave me was bow to Quan  The Am Bo Tat 108 times a day for 2 years.

What is your opinion on Cau Chin if anyone knows about him.  I plan on revisiting his temple and going to other temples to learn more about Buddhism. "
Buddhism,Justified Hatred?,"What is the purpose of this feeling? How can it be useful? In your opinion, is it ever okay to hate? 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate right now. Someone (who I have never met) has disrespected and mistreated someone I love and care about and I hate him. I really hate him for his actions. I hate him because of the false image he puts out into the world - the image of the happy-go-lucky guy who's just friends with everybody - this is not his true behavior. I know how he treats people when no one is watching, and I wish everyone else could know too.

&amp;#x200B;

I know at some point I must learn to forgive this person, who I have never even met, but I feel unable to at this point. I know this hatred is only hurting myself and those around me. I have recently come to Buddhism in order to deal with my anger, and it's helping with that a lot, and even when it comes to discussing hatred, but the feeling itself remains strong.

&amp;#x200B;

I think a lot about that quote that's probably from Mark Twain or something that goes ""Hatred is like drinking poison and expecting your enemy to die.""

&amp;#x200B;

I want to overcome hatred and live a life where I am able to have compassion for everyone, including my enemies, so this feeling of hatred is embarrassing to me. But overcoming this hatred seems difficult for a few reasons, some of which I will list now. 

* I know the fact that I have never met this person might make it easier for me to view him as nothing more than the worst of his actions, thus making it easy to hate him. 
* It is difficult for me to overcome this hatred because I feel I am correct and justified in hating him for his actions. The way he treats people goes completely against what I believe, so my hatred feels ""morally correct"".
* The hatred not only goes outward, but inward. I feel as if there is something that I could have done or said to the one I love to have prevented this situation from happening. I am very angry at myself.
* I will add more reasons as they come to me.

So what do you think? Can hatred ever be justified? And even if it can be, what is the correct way to deal with it?"

Buddhism,"New to Buddhism, looking for a crash course","Hi All,

Through therapy I've been turned on to the ideas of Buddha and mindfulness.  I am excited to be on this journey of self discovery and peace. I'm curious as to what this community has to offer in the way of understanding basic principles and meditative practices, specifically in the realm of a retreat. The idea of going on a retreat is daunting because there seems to be a lot of different types with different intentions. 

I'm looking to discover the absolute basics, in hopes that through that I can choose, not necessarily a clear path, but a direction in which I can take my practice. 

I'm sorry if there's a similar post to this that I've neglected to see. 

Thank you in advance! "
Buddhism,White Lotus (Chinese Subtitles),
Buddhism,"Are new ""souls"" created regularly or is there a static amount created in the start?","hello all,

not sure if this is a silly question or something that has been asked before.

I have a general interest in religions. I like learning about them and talking to those who practice them. 

Buddhism has always been one of the few religions that I feel a personal connection to that I have agreements with.  

I was just pondering on this question this morning.

I understand the concept of cycle of birth and death and your journey. 

are there people born that are ""fresh"" souls and not recycled?   the population on earth keeps growing and growing so I would assume that new souls have to be made?

but what determines if a body is given a recycled soul or a new one etc.

is there anything available in regards to information on this or is it just something to ponder on."
Buddhism,I am tired,"I begin to wonder if the human mind was meant to sustain such a long life-span. In the last century or so, our bodies have learned to grow older but our minds are still primitive as it can be. I am forever a slave to my basic instincts but chipped and chiseled by societal norms. 

I am very successful, in my early 30's, have great material things and have been to many beautiful places. I am not depressed (at least I don't think so) but I wonder if it's worth it to live this out. 

Consider the notion that life is a journey. The destination then, is nothing but death. The discipline of life must be our willingness to ""carry on"", learn to pick ourselves up, face adversity and overcome. Overcome challenges, obstacles, be mindful, be aware and be free...until you die. 

I am most envious of my cat. He poops when he wants, sleeps when he wants, ignores me when he wants but chooses to acknowledge me when I am needed. A cat truly ""lives in the moment"" and as far as I can tell, has very limited capacity for cognitive reasoning. In layman's terms, he truly, truly does not give a fuck and I truly, truly envy that position. 

I am not depressed. At most, I am unhappy. At the very least, I am tired. I'm just tired. I got to go to work tomorrow. I don't hate my job but I don't care for it. Day in and day out, I have to do this dance. And it's really tiresome. I gotta do this for another 50+ years? Sounds tiring.

Buddhism,Hurtful life at home. Making A Decision.,"Greetings.

I have decided that there is no better time than the present i can make this decision and im in need of some outside opinion.

Im 19, live in a relativity small town in the centre of Scotland, i dont know if that information will be useful or not, but my dilemma is this, since the age of around 14/15, and since then it has become a bigger and bigger part of my focus, but i never did much research, i always only understood the basics, and never really got into the teachings, that is until i turned 18 and since then ive been trying to read more and more, and with this, i think i have reach The A&amp;P well i  first got the felling i had reached it around 16 but i never knew what it was, the weird feelings while meditating, the emotions coming out of nowhere, but know im starting to lose where to find things to study, and to continue my growth, although this could be due to me being young and naive, or having not thought through all my possibilities, and yes i know being around the territory of A&amp;P means thoughts could be influenced by cycling.  I can also see arguments based on the three trainings, suggesting that such an abandon of my current life-platter is radically neglecting the training of morality to pursue the other two. In particular, just leaving would upset my parents immensely, but i feel it appropriate to give a quick life summary.

&amp;#x200B;

 I think it is wise to give a short summary of my life up to this point, as these details have led up to my current position. As much as I feel bad about just shooting off a long list of ""problems"" in my life, I feel it necessary to do so in order to show where I'm coming from. I love my parents and my sister, and I'm extremely grateful for the quality of life I live, the food and money provided, and the general comfort of life.  

 Of course, the typical teenager will complain about their parents, but please read this for what it is, rather than as the stereotypical angsty teen complaining. My parents both come from low-income households, where the father was unfaithful and left the wife and kids. and is such in this household, father left when i was 6 and never heard a word again. 

My mum is watching television quite frequently. She doesn't like to be talked to, really. If I try to talk to her while she's watching tv, she'll not look away, give a brief answer, and be obviously annoyed. She'll turn the tv up, and say that she's trying to watch. She gets home from work, changes out of work clothes, turns on the tv, and turns it off when it's time to go to bed. I see her taking all kinds of pills for headaches, aches, sleeping, and all sorts of things. She seems quite healthy to me, but she's constantly talking about what she thinks is wrong with her. I suspect she is a hypochondriac, and I suspect that her medical knowledge from tech school enables her to worry about a vast array of problems she's learned about. She constantly self-diagnoses herself with problems and goes to the doctor, but it seems that her only verified problem is poor eyesight and chronic migraines, of which the doctors don't understand. I attribute it to constant stress and worry. She is always worrying. She will often come into my room at night and ask if I smell something burning. She boards some doors at night for fear of break-ins. We have an alarm system too. She doesn't sleep well. I suspect she only gets 4 hours of sleep or so, and it seems to be extremely light. She has explained how her mind is constantly turning at night, how her worrying keeps her up. She has also expressed depression, which I will get to in a minute. When I talk with her, she talks about her and her boss, how her boss is like her son, how she is always getting compliments, and how much she hates one of her coworkers. She is constantly baking cakes, pies, brownies, and bringing treats to work, but doesn't seem to do these things at home. She has a tendency to unload for a very long period of time without any silent space, and then once she's done, walk away without me having said a word. If I try to tell her about my day, she will distantly say ""uh huh, uh huh"" as she walks away, turns on the tv, or does other things. When she asks me questions, they seem to be an attempt to prove my inadequacy. When I express having had a bad day, having felt poorly, having had a bad experience, she is almost certain to respond with ""You should have..."", making a point of how these things are my fault, some kind of shortcoming of my foresight or emotional strength. If I am to pursue it and explain how it's just an expression of the feelings that are getting to me, she may respond with, ""What am I supposed to do about it? I can't do anything about it"". 

She has blatantly told me that she doesn't trust me or my sister, and often makes outright incorrect claims about knowing we are doing sin. She has been known to literally run suddenly up and down stairs, and ask me, my sister, or my friends if we're doing something we shouldn't be doing. One time, she was pulling in the driveway as she saw me upstairs in the bathroom through the window. I went downstairs and played piano. She had seen me upstairs when she pulled in but then when she found me on the lower level when she came inside, she accused me of doing things I shouldn't be. She has stood outside my bathroom and accused me of masturbating. She has also told us of having, in her words, premonitions where we're drowning or dying somehow. This is not an exaggeration. My take of my mum is this: she grew up in a miserable household, but never learned to trust men, or maybe just humans in general, never learned to love herself, and never learned a set of social skills that I deem vital to raising children.  

 I admit that there is intense resent, but I, honestly, don't express it. I've learned to be very quiet, emotionally detached, and generally absent from the house. I don't try to talk to her anymore. I don't share feelings, concerns, school life, thoughts, daily activities, anything like that, unless there is a compelling need. I'm not cold though. I try to be a good son, since they are providing for me. I try to practice metta. I do the dishes, occasionally buy treats, take out garbage, and do nice things when they weren't asked of me. I say, ""hey, how was your day?"". I ask how I can help. I try to avoid any sort of disagreement, even over simple things, since she seems to lack the ability to discuss differing opinions without raising her voice, claiming that I'm condescending, and telling me not to challenge her.  

I remember being intensely interested in psychic stuff, meditation, enlightenment, and spirituality from at least age of 14  and I have a feeling that I was already cycling through nanas by that point, and it is possible that dark night stuff was involved. I remember feeling desperation, misery, helplessness, agony, hatred towards others and myself, and isolation. However, these fits of horrible feelings would usually lead up to this odd sort of compassion that seemed outside of myself, like a mother weeping over the pain of her child. From this perspective, I felt not only a sense of compassion for myself, but also for my parents and for what pain they must experience. I felt sorry for myself, sorry for them, and guilty for these feelings of compassion for those who I thought were causing me so much pain. I tried to talk to a counselor at school and she just told me that she saw it as a teen rebellion thing, and that if she were in my parents position, she would make me go to church. I gave up at that point, seeing nowhere at all to turn, and tried to kill myself by burning lots of charcoal in my car, while I listened to Chopin and read about his life. I took the missionary fund my parents had been saving for me, cashed it, bought some weed. Two miraculous things happened. One, I smoked a joint, figuring it would be a nice way to ease the stress of dying. Two, my friend skipped class and checked his email randomly, finding a suicide note that I had intended for him to pass on to my parents. Once I smoked that joint, something snapped in my mind. I just suddenly didn't want to die after I smoked it. I've heard similar stories to that effect. Then, my friend called and calmly but intimately implored me to keep living, to step out of the car and start over completely anew. I did that. I didn't tell anyone about this besides the friends who were involved in the phone call. I don't see how it would do any good to tell my seemingly unstable parents about this.  


I rebuilt myself. I learned that I could be my own center of stability. I learned that even in pain, there could be peace. Equanimity, I suppose. I learned the power of emotions, the power of thoughts, the power of attractive thinking, and the value and vulnerability of life. I realized that I wasn't the only one in such a situation of pain. I began to look at others and realize that beneath the facade, there was a mass of unacknowledged pain. I realized that we never really ""have it all together"", that any kind of together-ness was absolutely fictional, even in times of happiness. I saw how new-age stuff was falling short of realizing this imperfect nature, this unavoidable chaos, this unfixable imperfectness in every human. Having dropped to that extremely low point and stepping away into some kind of peace, I realized that even in the midst of the most turbulent pain, one could accept it and find that peace. I realized that I had insight of some kind, but these insights weren't really mature, formulated clearly like this, or well-practiced. But these knowledges were certainly there.

So I've been practicing meditation (jhana and vipassana) for about a year or so. I admit that it isn't a long time. However, I have the ability to enter (soft jhanas) 1-4, and seem to be able to get up to equanimity in insight meditation. I believe I crossed the A&amp;P long, long ago, since I've been obsessed with meditation, philosophy, energy, chakras, enlightenment, suffering, self, and religion through basically all of my teen years. I've been working towards stream entry. I find myself mostly between A&amp;P stuff, dark night stuff, and poking through to equanimity. Kenneth Folk said that once you cross the A&amp;P, you're on the ride, and you'll make choices to pursue that ride at the expense of other things. I've found this to be extremely true. I'm busy with college, but dharma stuff just takes over my mind. More and more, I'm losing the will and desire to do homework that I see as pointless. I see rigid systems and unenlightened, unhappy people trying to explain what true happiness and success is, along with fellow classmates, turning from interest in the beauty of life, to stress of work, obsession of money, and a cold, almost manic attempt to tune out anything spiritual, philosophical, or suggestive of inner-peace, happiness, bliss, joy, that kind of stuff. I understand the whole A&amp;P excitement and evangelicalism I may exhibit, but this seems different. Before college, these people loved to walk in the woods, speculate about the universe, try meditations, and contemplate the odd, frantic, posession-driven lifestyle led by the adults. Now, there seems to be some sort of cognitive dissonance, where these moments are in opposition to the ideas of success, wealth, power, ""making it big"". It makes me feel like I'm not growing up, like I'm somehow less mature, somehow less directed, somehow less successful, somehow less intelligent. This is reinforced by knowing that my parents have been talking to my sister in private, telling her that they don't think I'm going to succeed in school, don't think I'm going to find any work, don't think I'm trying, don't think I'm taking it seriously, don't think about anyone but myself. These are terrible things to hear, and they add up to, ""we don't believe in you or feel supportive of your life"". If they really cared, wouldn't they try to talk to me about it? 

My parents are paying me through college. I've offered to pay but they have said that they want to pay. I've only attended two semesters, but to be fair, I tested out and substituted free college for high school for my junior and senior years of high school, accumulating over a year's worth of credits. As I grow more and more uncertain that college is doing something for me, I worry that the longer I keep attending, the longer I waste my parents' money. The urge to drop out is strong and growing, and I worry that if I don't do it now, they'll be thousands of dollars more upset if I decide to do it down the road, or end up pursuing something other than a career in my degree-field.  

There's the dharma thing too. I'm under the impression that if I get stream-entry, I am likely to rid myself of a lot of suffering, remove a lot of the pain of self-referencing, and have a much more stable position to make life decisions from. The problem is, that I feel as though I don't have time to get the momentum to get stream entry. I'm busy paying attention to lectures, to studying and practising. I've heard of people getting stream entry at home or at work, and I suppose it's possible to get it, but I just have the feeling that I can't build up enough momentum to do it. I note when I get up and go to school, but it's just impossible to pay attention to notes during lectures and homework, and impossible to pay attention to lectures and homework during noting. Sometimes I get home and fall asleep in the evening, exhausted, and don't get up until the next day, then do it all again. Sometimes the dukkha nanas will come on so strong that I fell as though I can't make it to the end of a hallway without stopping and trying to find stability. Doing homework in intense misery is an impossibility. I fall apart upon the work. Then, there's the emotional pain and insecurity that I encounter so often with my mum, which is also hard to deal with during dukkha. I've tried to avoid bleed-through but the bottom line is, my effort seems to not have been enough, since I'm failing two classes and not really making any new progress in insight.   


I also have to consider this. Is my disenchantment with the life I'm living truly just because of the dukkha nanas? Will my concerns with the system of college just disappear once I get stream entry? Will I just be like, ""Oh, its all okay now and I can do this without worrying about the stuff I used to""? I am only speculating, but I don't think the concern will just disappear. Perhaps someone has experience here.   


Based on all of this, I'm considering deferring schooling, heading off to a monastery where I can focus all my efforts on stream entry and possibly beyond, and then deciding from that point what would be best to do with my life. I don't know though. I don't really have anyone to talk to about all this. I've thought of contacting various monasteries and seeing if there is anyone who would have this conversation. "
Buddhism,The Case Against “Buddhism”,
Buddhism,How do I know that me acting spirtual is not just me being in denial of depression.,"I have many spiritual and buddhist beliefs. But it seems that no madder what thought I put into my head about living a joyess life. And when I look at others, they portray a positive and energetic vibe. But when I'm alone, I feel nothing. This lack of emotion causes me to feel deprived of life. It usually makes me feel exhausted of it also. I put these beleifs into my head that I am happy because I can get rid of the obstacles of me future. For example, my mind is constantly thinking about the future, like homework, tests, or performances. I can loose care for the things in the future. I thought that by thinking this, it would make me happy that I can live in the present. But I feel like vibes around me control my feelings and actions. So, I believe in Buddha, and all the love he brings. But I also feel like I am just using Buddhism to cover up my real feelings inside. (The cause may be depression). "

Buddhism,Buddhism: Very misunderstood/fake in the West?,"Unlike the more established Semitic religions of Christianity but also Islam and Judaism in the West, I feel there is a massive misunderstanding of Buddhism in the West. Tons of people are claiming to be Buddhists. Tons of people are claiming to know what Buddhism is. I just wanted to post this to discuss and enlighten myself to reality.

\-  What qualifies as Buddhism? Seems to me there is absolutely no established dogma for all Buddhist denominations, and ""classical Buddhism"" (which is monastic only as I understand it) is completely different than many modern forms of Buddhism.

\- Are any of these modern new age Buddhism, actually Buddhism? A member of my family turned to Soka Gakkai Buddhism, and these guys seems very radical, proletising (trying to convince you to join them), and very irrational and uncompromising with their ideas.

It just seems to me that tons of people across the world call themselves Buddhist, and claim to represent what the Budda said. For instance in the case of Soka Gakkai Buddhism (itself Nichiren Buddhism) they basically think that chanting a mantra will fulfill all their wishes. Is that really Buddhism?

And that is just one ""sect"". There are many other denominations that I feel are really not what Buddhism is about. For instance Zen which basically is the same but with meditation only.

And in many discussions with these new age Buddhists (who are never monastic and do basically what they want in life), I felt many of them are just as arrogant and feeling morallistically superior as any other religious radical. Some of them even argued against my personal political view which shocked me as I felt that religion should not mix with politics as its a personal matter.

I know everything I wrote tackles many subjects, but I wanted to start this basic discussion. To make it simple...Is ""Buddhism"" just a huge container of hundreds different belief that dont match each other, with the Buddha's teaching being long distorted since? I feel the more you go East into Japanese/Chinese Buddhism and the more you steer away from what Buddhism meant originally. It feels almost like the original Catholic Christianity and the protestant schism of later centuries where they took Christianity into a completely new direction.

It seems to me lots of modern Western Buddhist movement are just corrupted versions of Buddhism and basically organisations where Whites/Europeans with an identity crisis (like typical Nihilistic modernist European) go for refuge? I dont want to generalise but this is what I experienced. And you wouldnt believe what I heard in these organisations. So called ""masters"" Constantly spitting venom at Western civilisation and Christianity, saying how Asia was superior, etc (when in fact they have tons of problems, including in Buddhist organisations which are as crime ridden as the Catholic Church or other religious org!)"
Buddhism,A better way to point to Ultimate Reality,"2500 years ago the Buddha made one unique contribution that has challenged people to describe since then, while acknowledging this fundamental truth/experience could not be put into words. It wasn't the '***Renunciation of the Eight Worldly Concerns***': gain/loss, pleasure/pain, fame/disgrace, praise/blame ... neither was it the ***Precepts*** of good living that go with renouncing those things : no killing (be loving), no stealing (be generous), no lying (be honest) etc...

Many religions have that, though the motivation of the Abramic religions is the threat of enternal hellfire rather than ""living contrary to those precepts has been found to bring hardship and real-life consequences"".

It wasn't '***Love***' or '***Compassion***', for again, many religions have that as their central aspiration (though perhaps it isn't always followed)...

The Buddha's astounding realisation was something that couldn't be put into words, though he tried. Many words were used: *interconnectivity, emptiness, selflessness, insubstantial, 'Ultimate Wisdom'.*

'*Insubstantial*' comes close, and '*emptiness*' (all phenomenon are empty of inherent existence) became widely used as a term to describe 'Ultimate Truth' or 'Ultimate Reality'...a term evocative of Nihilism, which isn't what the Buddha was driving at. The realisation was, to put it badly into words, that everything including himself, his personality, his body, the whole world, was insubstantial, that phenomenon only existed in a state of arising relative to and dependent on their conditions, lacking their own inherent existence, an everychanging state of interconnected fluxuation with no beginning or end.

Just to read that sounds quite preposterous. **""Of COURSE things exist!""** 

That's the problem with words. Sometimes words can be very effective at describing something, a leaf, for example: it's small, about the size of a hand, flat, soft, green, bilaterally symmetrical, with a stem running out of one side and the other side ending in a point...

...something like that - *a mental picture forms*.  Someone who never experienced a leaf (somehow) would have a vague image of a leaf and could identify a leaf as a leaf the first time they saw one, even if they had never seen a leaf before.

But the experience the Buddha was trying to communicate is more difficult to put into words, and less commonly experienced. How do you describe 'insubstantial' or 'interconnected' in relation to a world very obviously made of clearly separate objects?
That was the Buddha's problem...and this has been the problem of every realised Buddhist who ever wanted to share the experience with the suffering people around them.  

**""Look!"", they implore, ""We are all one! Literally!""**

""Yeah, whatever""

**""Look! We're insubstantial, so don't worry so much!""**

""Yeah right, whatever...""

So many words, just words, and always when using them was the knowledge that any words used to describe it are just a finger pointing at the moon, not actually the moon.

""***LOOK!***"" (the teacher points a finger at the moon)...and all we see is a finger being waved in our faces. A finger can't show the experience of the moon, that makes no sense.  The point is that it's nearly impossible to imagine 'insubstantial' or 'interconnected' outside of one's own ego-experience (meditation is a good place to 'try' to experience this)...

...until the invention of computers and computer graphics 2500 years after the Buddha first talked about it...

I'll try to explain my idea as directly as possible. It's still a concept to be ultimately discarded, it's still just a finger pointing at the moon, but it's a *better* finger than others, perhaps. 

Anyway, despite my poor skills, I'll try to explain:

The Buddha and Enlightened Beings have been trying to explain the perception of 'Ultimate Reality', while understanding the futility of putting into words the wordless. Many methods, many words, have been used to point to it: *egolessness, dependent-arising, insubstantial, impermanent, empty, 'lacking in inherent existence'*, and right on the coat-tails of these words are the great Zen masters rightfully laughing at that stinking pile of unsatisfactory descriptions.

So I've got one more: but it isn't a word exactly, or rather, it isn't a useful word or idea without the newly available visualizations made possible through the use of computers...

The word?  Two words:  ***fractal insubstantiality***

Before computer graphics you could not describe visually such a thing as fractals. As I said, I can describe a leaf : small, flat, green, soft, bilateral symmetry, slightly veined (?) with a central stem extending from one side...

**[NOW WATCH THIS](https://youtu.be/PD2XgQOyCCk)**

Now (after watching) try and put the experience of journeying infinitely 'down' a fractal into words. At best you might use words like 'recurring' or 'pattern' or 'colours' without really creating a mental image of it in the mind of the listener.  There is really no way to describe using language the (somewhat nauseating) experience of diving infinitely into any 'point' of a fractal.

But now we can describe it, with computer processors and video

How is the Universe insubstantial? Just like in the video, it's *fractally insubstantial*, infinitely interconnected, with forms that can be conventionally described but actually whose borders cannot be located. 

So too are actions like this, or the effects of words, or the summation of a 'person' - their edges cannot be found, they are interconnected infinitely with everything. Where does one end and the other begin? Using this new term, fractal insubstantiality, things can (still only conceptually) be seen more clearly. Suddenly things become clearer, such as the ***Three Marks of Existence***:

**Imperfect**: it is our discriminative egos that mar each moment with discontent and interfere with 'our' direct unfiltered perception of each moment.

**Impermanent**: We're usually attuned to the existence and meanings of this one, irritating or scary as it can be

**Fractally Insubstantial**: Ah! With this new visual concept each moment is activated with real understanding *how* we do not exist as discrete objects...that everything is a play of interconnectivity (as the desiring and fearful ego drops away).  Ultimately it's a 'concept' that's easier to let go of as a mental formation when the time comes then a word like 'emptiness'.

Understanding fractal insubstantiality (the *Buddha Jewel*) there's something to practice/experience along with the other two principal aspects of the spiritual path, Renunciation/Precepts (the *Dharma Jewel*) and Love...(oops, I meant to say the *Sangha Jewel*) ;)

I hope these unskilled ramblings can be of benefit to at least one person


"
Buddhism,Recollecting 2018 – The Right Way," 

Year 2018 will see its end in a few days. Many people across the globe will celebrate the dawn of year 2019 with splendor and start day to day work in the New Year. In the next few days public media such as radio, television, newspapers, magazines and the internet will start reflecting on year 2018 presenting the highlights which took place in the social, political, economic, religious, and geographic domains. Recalling the progress and success of the above areas will result in joy. Declines and failures will cause sorrowful thoughts. Some incidents that took place in year 2018 will be accepted in equanimity. Based on these past information the media will then make many forecasts and projections for the upcoming year. With this exposure to media you will be loaded with abundant detail and end up as ""an informed individual"". 

These “informed individuals” approach the New Year in few ways. Inclining towards many unwholesome activities some breach one or more precepts from the five precepts in the dawn of the New Year. Some celebrate the New Year by engaging themselves in religious activities such as visiting the temple and listening to sermons. For some, the New Year is not an outstanding event in the calendar. They are not disturbed by it and continue to follow their usual routines. Evaluating the superiority or the inferiority of the above mentioned ways is up to the reader who is well versed in the wholesome (*kusala*) and unwholesome (*akusala*).  You have to contemplate on the relevance and the impact of the past year's highlights to your spiritual development. In simple words being informed about such matters of the physical world can be seen as “clearing a litter bin"" on to our heads.

Even though the media present and analyse information about the past year in an attractive manner, they can't explore into our minds. Exploring and drilling down into our minds is a task that we ourselves are solely obliged to. Thus, this document will provide a guide to look into our ""internal world"" disregarding the ""external world"".

Contemplating on the past year in a mindful manner is challenging. Usually people tend to nurture defilements when they recall their past. While recalling the memories of sensual pleasures 'desire' is nurtured. Recalling bad things done and the good things that were not done people nurture 'anger' in gross and subtle forms. Buddha's teachings mention that people bewailing on the past wither away like cut green reeds thrown on a hot stone. This happens because repenting is a form of anger (*dosa*). But Contemplating on the past with wisdom is invaluable for spiritual development for a practitioner who is following the path of nibbāna.

“Paccavekkhati” is the original pāli word which is appropriate in this context. It means to contemplate, to look upon, consider, review and understand. The word “Paccavekkhati” refers to contemplation on the past, present and future. In this context you have to contemplate on the way you spent year 2017 through an eye of wisdom.

**The Right Way to Contemplate**

Recalling the past based on the worldly criteria will nurture defilements. There is no possibility of misinterpretation if this reflection is done based on the Dhamma which is focused on self-enlightenment. In the *Dhammapada* there is a stanza stating ""If one knows that one loves oneself, he will take good care of himself”. At least during one of the three stages of the life of a human being, namely childhood and adolescence, middle age and old age, a wise person, man or woman keeps vigilant over oneself."" If a lay person becomes heedless in their child hood and adolescence they have to be vigilant in the middle age. If the person becomes heedless in the middle age with family obligations they have to be vigilant in the old age. One cannot find anyone anywhere whom one loves more than oneself. The one who protects morality (*sīla*) is protected by morality. Therefore for a person who loves oneself than any other, the reflection on the past year should be done based on morality. A layperson’s morality is enforced through the five precepts; namely refraining from killing living beings, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, lying, and taking intoxicating substances.

For this the following series of questions should be asked from yourself….!!!

**In year 2018.................**

How was my morality in the past year? Your mind will come up with a true answer. If you have lived in line with the precepts the mind will accept this with delight. Otherwise, it will resist accepting. No matter what the answer is you have to accept it because it is the truth.

1. How many times did I breach the precepts? Your mind will state the frequency. The answers will be given as daily, once in a few days, weekly, monthly, randomly or I did not breach any precepts.
2. What are the precepts breached by me? From refraining from killing living beings, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, lying and taking intoxicating substances you will know that you breached one or few precepts.
3. When a situation to breach the precepts appears did you knowingly breach them? Most people who breach precepts know when they reach a point of a breaching.  However, the breaching takes place because they are blinded by defilements. Even if they don't know about precepts there is no escape from the law of kamma. Sometimes your mind will come up with justifications and reasoning for the breaching (E.g. because of my children, spouse, parents, friends, employer etc.). If you pay attention you will be able to see these justifications coming up in various forms as well.
4. What was the nature of the mind when a breach of precepts was taking place? In violating the five precepts the mind is filled with unwholesome thoughts. You will be able to recall the defiled, spoiled nature in the mind when an unwholesome emerged. You will recall the pure nature of the mind if you fight back with energy and didn't breach a precept when a situation for breaching appears. You will also recall the feeling of the joy of blamelessness.
5. What are the factors which encouraged the breaching of precepts? What are the factors that encouraged the protecting of precepts? The following are few reasons;

* Some individuals are forever inclined towards breaching precepts. It is a routine activity. This may happen as a continuation of the activities practiced in the past lives. Some protect the precepts due to the same reason: because they were good in the past, they are good in the present too. Even though you cannot see your past life you have to understand your own status.
* An individual’s associations have a significant impact on the spiritual growth and decline of a person. Association of virtuous friends results in protecting the precepts. If sinful friends are associated it will result in a breach of precepts.
* Some individuals are learned on the wholesome and unwholesome. However, when a situation to breach precepts appears they are not mindful on the worthy results of protecting precepts and perils of breaching them.

**By falling away from virtue the immoral person encounters five perils:**

* Great loss of wealth through heedlessness
* An evil reputation
* A timid and troubled demeanor in every society, be it that of nobles, brahmins, householders, or ascetics
* Death in bewilderment
* At the breaking up of the body after death, rebirth in a realm of misery, in an unhappy state, in the after world, in hell.

**The five blessings that are accrued to the righteous man through the practice of virtue:**

* Great increase of wealth through his diligence
* A favorable reputation
* A confident deportment, without timidity, in every society, be it that of nobles, brahmins, householders, or ascetics
* A serene death
* At the breaking up of the body after death, rebirth in a happy state, in a heavenly world.

 Some individuals recollect the worthy results of protecting the precepts and the perils when a situation to breach a precept appears. But their faith (*saddhā*) is not dominant to suppress and stand against that unwholesome state. 

**A Conducive Setup for Morality**

In addition to the worldly goals set for 2019, a goal has to be set to protect morality. Mere goal setting will not serve the purpose. Factors supporting to protect the precepts have to be reinforced. Generally, many think that the present cannot be changed as it is determined by the preceding *kamma*. But the truth is that the influence from the past *kamma* can be changed by altering the present factors. Because of the lack of wholesome *kamma* some will not have the association of virtuous friends at ease. In that event, virtuous friends who support the morality of friends have to be explored. Sinful friends need to be distanced. One should also determine to listen to dhamma and contemplate them. Such orderly practices to maintain discipline will undoubtedly lead to protection of one’s self - the one a person love the most.

This article merely provides a guide to contemplate the past year. However, one should bear in mind that the practical application can vary from person to person because the minds of individuals vary.  Hence, a thousand people will think about a particular thing in thousand different ways. Therefore, based on the above guide the ways of reflection has to be implemented as appropriate.

Morality is the starting point of the journey to enlightenment. Contemplating on the well protected precepts result in concentration (samādhi). There were*bhikkus* who became enlightened using the concentration which originated from contemplation on Morality.  Also, there were lay persons who achieved worldly success through the same practices. Gaining such results is possible to date. Thus, this note ends with a kind invitation for you to protect morality.

Buddhism,How should I go about starting to practice Buddhism?,"I have read up about it, and I have a good idea of the core ideas. However, I don't know what I should start doing besides meditation. I don't meditate daily, I am working on that. But what else should I do? "
Buddhism,"where does a beginner go to even learn, read, start?","I figured this is the perfect place to ask.   


background: 25 y/o F, finished grad school in social work, passionate about helping others, working in mental health, battling my own anxiety/ocd, meditation saved my life. i am looking to begin to learn, dabble, explore buddhism. where do i even begin? what resources are there? i live in Toronto but am open to beginning to read online before i go out in-person"
Buddhism,How does r/Buddhism feel about masturbation?,"I want to stimulate some discussion about one of the five precepts to restrain from ""sexual misconduct."" How does the lay Buddhist interpret this precept, especially in regards to following a ""middle path?"" Total restraint? The rare instance of masturbation? Porn or no porn?

I know this can be an awkward subject for some, but let's talk. How do you as a Buddhist interpret and incorporate this precept in your own life? My main point of curiosity is about masturbation specifically, but feel free to expand the discussion to the realm of sexual practice with a committed partner."
Buddhism,Advice on dating in the modern world while maintaining the precepts.,"I don’t practise a particular school of Buddhism but consider myself a secular Buddhist with an interest in learning more about the spiritual aspects of Buddhism if this reveals itself as part of my journey into a better understanding. I do however; follow the precepts of Buddhism; the 8 fold path and; generally speaking, the philosophical aspects of the practise. 

I am newly single after coming out of a 3 year relationship and, after dipping my toes into the muddy waters of online dating again, realise that I would benefit from guidance on how to uphold my beliefs and precepts when it comes to dating and causal dating. 

I admit to being very naive when it comes to any particular schools opinions on sex; sexual relationships and the importance of these but I’m fairly sure there is no ‘universal’ idea that Buddhists should only date or have sexual relationships with those they intend to marry or have children with-I could be wrong here though. 

As my practise had improved I am trying to practise non-attachment with loving kindness allow this isn’t always easy for me. I have noticed however that non-attachment is very beneficial to me when I concentrate on not clinging and not trying to manipulate the world around me-I.e not trying to change reality. 

I also want to respect others who I might enter into any type of relationship with; even if it is only a sexual one; without attaching to them when this is not something they desire. 

As a women; I have found however that men, and let me explain I am very aware that this is not simply a ‘male issue’ , tend to become very attached to me and this causes them to suffer when I want to take things slowly OR have no interest in me at all and I therefore tend to cling to them. 

This is the age old problem of course but I wonder if others have had similar experiences with dating and sexual relationships. 

I am also really interested to hear your opinions on ‘casual sex’ as a Buddhist and how you maintain loving kindness and compassion in the modern dating world that, to me, feels like the antithesis of Buddhist practise "
Buddhism,Man in search of peace,"I am 26M. And ever since I have been an adult I've been struggling to detach from a disturbing thought. For an instance, my flatmate made a mistake in calculating a share of groceries. When it came to my attention all i could do was think about was how i am going to get that SOB for that mistake. I just kept on thinking about that for hours untill i finally talked with him and resolved the issue. Mind you, I actually talked with him with utmost politeness. And on top of that while I was stuck on that thought I was actually aware about it and wanted to stop thinking about it yet I couldn't . So how do i actually stop thinking about such trivial matters?"
Buddhism,Getting older,"I've noticed in my short 40 years on this planet, it seems that we work our asses off, do the right thing as much as possible, yet we lose the ones we love the most when we finally have time to spend with them. i watched my ex-wife's father, who was a dedicated religious man, lose his faith after losing his mother and sister, he was 65 and just retired. this was one night having a beer at the kitchen table, it was heart breaking to see. now fast forward a few years, im happily divorced and have been with a beautiful woman for almost 5 years. i woke up may 28th 2016 (less than a year after we bought our house together) to her not in bed, thinking she must have fallen asleep on the couch, i go downstairs to check on her and she had passed that night of a heart attack. i used Buddhism and meditation heavily after, but am starting to find its all hollow, and is meaning less and less to me by the day. how, what, why, am i supposed to make of all this...feeling incredibly lost and a bit hopeless......

Buddhism,Trying to understand 'Karma'.,"I was just wondering about karma. There are a few doubts that come to my mind. I really need to discuss them. They are -:

1. I believe people are good and most of the people hurt others unintentionally. They just look for their own benefit and are oblivious to the fact that their actions may hurt another being. Does these kind of actions create bad karma?

2. If someone did something bad to me intentionally, do I deserve to be treated like that due to the bad karma i may have created in my past? 
If it is so then what about the first time it would have happened. The first time person 'A' would have done something bad intentionally to person 'B' but the person 'B' had no bad karma. So why did he suffer? 
As we consider universe just a play ( I personally do.) So maybe that means the karma works the other way around too. If you have suffered for no reason maybe you will get happiness in exchange. 

3. If you believe in law of attraction. Then it seems like it contradicts karma in a certain way. If you attract what you are and what you think, you may go around hurting people with a mindset that you deserve good and attract it. Then you may never get punished for your bad actions ( I read it in an article somewhere )

Can you help me to see things a bit more clearly?"
Buddhism,A Buddhist view on financial savings,"I am currently a university student and, unlike many of my friends, I am quite good at organizing my finances. I have a part time job and can make my quarterly loan last with money to save. Although I am in a reasonably stable financial position I always find that if I have to pay for something unexpected then I become very irritated, it doesn't even have to be a large amount. Through my practice I've learnt to note my irritation and try to let it pass but it always manifests again. 

Is there any guidance or literature you can point me towards to help me improve on this issue?

Another problem I am having is that I have saved quite a reasonable amount of money but do not desire to spend it on anything in particular. I have always been told to save for the future but to quote Alan Watts '*So many people of wealth understand much more about making and saving money than about using and enjoying it. They fail to live because they are always preparing to live*'.

How can I improve on this issue? Should I be saving for a future that may not happen at all?

Buddhism,What to do when you feel like punching someone in the face? Is it justified?,"Hello,

I've never been a violent person. But sometimes I feel that I want to punch someone in the face.

There is this guy who I always meet at social events and neighbourhood. He will always belittle me. Make jokes on me and sometimes even touch my head like if I were a pet, in a very very subtle way.

I feel like a pressure cooker about to explode every time I see him. I've spoken with him and he always acts in a confused way ""What are you talking about?"".

I try to avoid this guy but I always end up meeting him somehow.

I feel like a punch in the face or a slap would be a good option for him to learn that he shouldn't mock people and make fun of them.

Would love to hear your opinion/thoughts on skillful use of violence

Thank you."

Buddhism,Aren't Diseases Like Alzheimer's Clear Evidence Of No Self?,"Alzheimer's degrades the aggregates. John Smith, for example, gets alzheimer's disease and his memory degrades. His critical thinking skills leave him. He will eventually not recognize even himself. Parts of what made up what he considered a *self*, as *me* and *mine*, fade away. Where did the *self* go if it is real? Did it disappear? But John Smith is still alive so he has to still be *himself*, correct? You can reach out and touch him and he is still physically here. But *he* isn't. The *self* changes even more drastically than normal as the aggregates dissolve away because of the disease. Isn't this clear evidence of *no self*?

This false sense of self is atop the columns of aggregates which support it. Knock down a few columns and the *self* breaks away. "
Buddhism,Thought about nirvana/enlightenment,"I noticed that I had a feeling like I needed to do or be something to be a Buddha/Buddhist/enlightened, but now I feel like living with the expectation that there’s something you need to achieve to become a Buddha is counter productive. I feel like I was attaching myself to the concept of a Buddha instead of doing what the Buddha would do. Not sure if anyone else has had the same feeling about buddhism but I think it’s worth exploring a bit cause there are a lot of other religions that have different “rules” or philosophies and I feel like there’s nothing wrong with trying out the rules and seeing if they work but sometimes it seems like people accept the rules before they actually see them work and understand them on their own.

I've started practicing conscious meditation (my therapist had already taught me some tools). I also like his teachings about the true meaning of compassion. I always believed that to be good, a person must turn into a doormat. I never truly understood non-violence. Hahn explains that compassion allows us to criticize bad actions and to fight injustice, but that we must do that without hating our counterpart. What are your thoughts about this author? "
Buddhism,Experienced some kind of depersonalization for a second time,
Buddhism,Confused about Buddhist attainments,"I have some queries which I hope I can get some answers on.

1. Is Arahantship something only Theravadians aspire? Whereas those from the Mahayanan school take up the Boddhistava path?
2. Those who have reached Arahantship are considered to be of higher attainment than Boddhistavas. Is that correct? But it appears that we tend to venerate Boddhisatvas more eg Avalokitsvera. Why is that so?
3. Conventional wisdom suggests that one cannot teach in an university if one only has a high school certificate. That being the case, how can a Boddhisatva help other beings achieve Liberation when they themselves are not liberated? Or did I get the concept wrong?

I'm no Buddhist scholar, so would appreciate a more layman-ish explanation. Many thanks in advance!"

Buddhism,How (exactly) do Buddhists view consciousness as impermanent?,"I've been studying Buddhism in more depth lately, co-relating it to my own spiritual studies and practice.  And although I find that it contains many profound realizations, I have an issue with Buddhist tenet that consciousness is seen as impermanent. It is basically one of the two issues that prevents me from embracing Buddhism as my own path as it contradicts my own experience.

I view consciousness as three-fold: the content of consciousness (sensations, emotions, thoughts and images), the quality of consciousness (dull and sleepy, sharp and awake) and awareness itself (the state or ability of being aware, conscious, perceptive).

Now while I can agree and find that the first two ""aspects"" of consciousness (its content and quality) can and do change, the third (awareness) in my experience never does. It is just there, ever present, unchanging. It does not ""arise and cease.""

Although you could argue this awareness ""arises"" as co-dependent to its content, in my experience and by reading descriptions of different higher jhanas that is not necessary the case.

How do you understand this issue and how do you view consciousness as being impermanent? Thanks."

Buddhism,Buddhism and pests,Let me preface this by saying I'm by no means a Buddhist or even a lay-practitioner. I have read some Buddhist material and have tried to incorporate it into my life and have found it to be very beneficial. Now for the question I had. Where we live during the winter we get mice in our home like clockwork every year. Every year we have to put out traps and get rid of them. I always feel bad about having to kill them. We tried those catch and release type traps and they either escaped before we could get them out of the house or were taken out of the house and some how found their way back. Basically I'm just curious if anything is ever said about these pest/human interactions in Buddhist teachings or works. Thanks in advance. 
Buddhism,Confusion about aspects of Buddhism,"Hi all, please excuse my ignorance... I have been interested in Buddhism for some time but too concerned, based on the philosophical parts I've read about, to pursue a practice. I'm wondering if anyone can help shed some light. 

So regarding non-attachment. I get that it can help one be compassionate and have stronger relationships, because you're not clinging to what you want the other person to be or do. But taken to completion, wouldn't it lead to the breakdown of ongoing interpersonal relationships? I mean if you approach people with equanimity, what maintains social bonds such as friendships, family, marriages? I am interested in Buddhism but not if delving too deeply would cause me to feel uncommitted to the relationships in my life, my partner/parents etc. To not show them preference in some way would cause them a lot of suffering, after all. 

Also, does showing compassion for others not increase the likelihood that they will become attached to you and suffer if you ultimately let them down in some way? And if your compassion gives them happiness, a transitory state that they might cling to, isn't that giving them suffering in a way? 

Finally, I somewhat understand the concept of anatta, but what part of you is deciding to do things, such as meditate, eat, drink, etc., if there is no independent self? 

My confusion over these issues causes me anxiety and existential dread because I'm scared to learn more and scared not to. Hopefully someone has some thoughts.

Buddhism,"Meditation, or How to Open a Walnut With an Ocean","I'm still very green when it comes to meditation. I've mostly done Zazen, but I've been reading a lot of Theravada Suttas and commentaries, and I thought it would be interesting to give Vipassana a try. It's not like I would be disrupting some long-established practice, right?

So anyway, last night wasn't a *bad* night per se, but it was a fierce one. I felt lonely and restless. My mind was on fire, as it often is. I won't get too personal, but I feel doors in my life opening that I'm not entirely sure I want to open. Again, not *bad* doors, just unsettling ones. I didn't get to sleep until early this morning, and it wasn't very restful. When I woke up I had the very kindly but insistent desire to meditate, but rather than Zazen this time I tried Vipassana and it was great. I felt like I could do it, and my 20 minutes didn't feel like 50 hours like with shikantaza.

Now, the Soto Zen part of me always says that I shouldn't be sitting for any particular reason, and if I get some benefit from it I should be careful not to make getting those benefits a goal. Rather, just sit. I believe I actually sat in that spirit this morning, but I did get some benefit from it. My restless, fiery state of mind has subsided quite a bit. My anxieties and concerns are still there. There was no magic solution or comfortable way out of addressing the issues that are bearing on me, but I feel softened. Like there is less suffering in having them than there was before. I like this conditional feeling of peace. Maybe I shouldn't make a goal of it, but isn't there some use in hoping that whatever the future brings, the restful quality of meditation might suffuse into all the corners of your life?

A metaphor I've been thinking about: the great mathematician Alexander Grothendieck once described his method of doing mathematics as akin to submerging a walnut into the waters of a warm ocean. Other mathematicians would simply use a hammer or a chisel to force the walnut open. His way, however, was to let the water soften the shell over long periods of time until at last it opened of its accord. I have always been drawn to this image. Of course, on some level, it seems absurd. Why not just use the hammer? It takes you to the same place right? But does it? Maybe we learn more about the walnut than we ever could by our continuous observation of it over the months and years of its submersion. The folks who just break it open and eat the meat forget all about it once it has been consumed, but the ones who wait learn all there is to know, or at least all that they are capable of knowing. They don't forget the shell in their hunger for the nut inside. They see that the shell and what it surrounds are the same thing. Subtle, infinite, inexhaustible, a complete reflection of the universe itself."
Buddhism,Can you please give me an answer about forgiveness? I'm struggling.,"So far, I've understood (also from some really insightful posts on here, which I am grateful for) that refusing to forgive is like replaying the same violent scene in my mind without any positive outcome. That I have to understand that my anger and pain will eventually pass. But this, from what I understood, implies that the harm done to me is completely in the past. My case is a little bit different. Let's say, without going into too much detail, that one person hurt me many years ago. Their action has caused a chronic illness that can be somehow managed, but not completely cured. So I have to live everyday with the consequences of their actions. I wouldn't say that they have ruined my life, but, well, before their abuse I had a perfectly good health, and now I don't. I really want to move on, but it seems impossible to me. What does Dharma teach about situations like this?"
Buddhism,Question about mindfulness and thoughts,"So I am relatively new to mindfulness meditation.

I have been reading the book *Mindfulness in Plain English* and I am a little confused about what to do with thoughts.

My understanding is that mindfulness is about being of emotions, but concentrating on the breath. With that being said, when you have a thought during practice, are you meant to explore it or simply cast it aside?

If you are meant to concentrate on breath, how do you become aware of emotions? Do you explore your emotions outside of meditation?

Thanks everyone"
Buddhism,How do I reject hate?,"My mind is full of atrocious thoughts. I’d personally never harm even a fly,but I think of harming humans all the time. I want to see some people lined against the wall and shot. I want people dead,I want some to be tortured,and their heads mounted on pikes so that people will learn from their mistakes.

These are all impulses that I make when I’m angry. I get angry a lot,even though I don’t express my feelings by harmings others,even with words,I am full of horrible thoughts,that I sate with extreme metal music,which is itself completely non wholesome as it deals with satanism,animal sacrifices and all kinds of evil. I’d be glad not to need to listen to them just so I can relieve the pressure.

I don’t like that. This is bad karma,the Buddha did not teach that,how do I learn to reject this? My actions may be of a good man but my mind is completely polluted,how do I clean it?"

Buddhism,thought i had figured out how not to suffer anymore. but now it fails and i am so confused.,"some six month ago i realized that if i decided to not suffer anymore, i could stop suffering. i was able to let go the grunge i had harbored for old injuries and injustices done to me. i was able to let go of my hate and of my wish for retribution. it felt just great.

one night meditating (high) i discovered a bright gem in my soul. an endless source of light and energy glowing like the sun. i identified it as love, and i relearned to love myself in this short and yet endless moment. i realized that this source could not be diminished by sharing, i knew it was strong enough to include anyone and everything and that it would grow not dim if i did.  

for most of my life, emotions had been buried in my soul. i usually did not even know how i felt, the only feeling that came easy to me was anger. suddenly, i was happy almost all the time, and if i was not, i knew why and i knew that it would only bother me as long as i allowed it to do so.

so i changed. and, for the first time in my 40 years old life, i deeply fell in love. 

now, the women i do love is in another relation to complicated for me to explain in detail at this point, and the details do not really matter anyhow. what matters is that i realize my mistakes and jet i am unable to change my mind.

i did not want to stop loving her even if i could. why would i? even if it hurts me its much better then this nothingness i knew so long. even if my love is not returned, would not the knowledge to be loved benefit the other?

i realize i need to get rid of these unhealthy wishes, desires and fantasies i have - but i can not.  i feel that we could benefit each other so much. i feel so strongly that i am in this place, at that work, with the coworkers (not just her) for a reason. but i can not and do not fully trust my feelings. how could i? my mind is clouded and what i think feels like hubris at times.

i am so confused. i think i should have gone through this as a much younger age and more then once. dealing with it now at this point in my life is so difficult.

i do not even know what to ask here or if this is the right sub. if there was a moan flair i had picked it.

Buddhism,Question on householders and enlightenment,"Hi everyone,

I've been mulling over a few concepts and was hoping someone could help me find any error of my thinking or discuss/ guide me towards some resources for further research.

1. In most traditions, and especially Theravada traditions, a vow of celibacy seems to be a requirement for becoming a monk. I do understand this position pragmatically (monks need to devote themselves to practice, lust is a significant source of attachment) but am confused on whether this is necessary to reach enlightenment. More generally, are there certain actions that inherently incompatible with reaching enlightenment full stop (say, they always lead to Dukkha)? If so, how is this not a form of avoidance? Should unwholesome actions be thought of as slowing progression or as impediments to enlightenment?

2. Can a householder/layman reach enlightenment or is renunciation required? If they cannot, why is this?

Buddhism,How do I know if I can genuinely call myself Buddhist?,"I grew up Christian and ended up atheist and/or agnostic for about 8 years.

I've dabbled in meditation and have a mala, but I'm not sure if I can genuinely consider myself Buddhist. To compare this to Christianity, Christians sort of grow up in the culture and scripture generated by the Bible. So, it seems like a Christian becomes a Christian when they achieve a certain level of understanding of Christianity and also believe in it. No one expects a Christian to memorize the Bible or even read the whole thing.

I don't know. I think meditation is quite beautiful and much better than what many Christians do, which is to ask for things from God (health, money, etc). To me, that just seems wrong. To have faith in God means not being concerned with his plan for you.

Anyway, I just wanted to know what y'all think about this. Are there any foundational texts I should read?"

Personally, I see most of the posts with skepticism, as I think some of them are just made to be ""edgy"", but in general it struck a nerve. I wasn't able find and answer to yet, so I was hoping the community has more insight.

Buddhism,I recently found a poem by Rumi that describes fully an important flavor of the Metta meditation that I found essential and game changing.," 

* The temple of love is not love itself;
* True love is the treasure,
* Not the walls about it.
* **Do not admire the decoration,**
* **But involve yourself in the essence**,
* The perfume that invades and touches you-
* The beginning and the end.
* Discovered, this replace all else,
* The apparent and the unknowable.
* Time and space are slaves to this presence.   


[Mewlana Jalaluddin Rumi](https://www.poemhunter.com/mewlana-jalaluddin-rumi/poems/)   


In the past I tried to convey this flavor with sentences like.  
I try to cultivate Metta by fully being what the phrase I am repeating is pointing at. (unconditional love, kindness, ... etc.)

Buddhism,'Why Buddhism is True' - Views?,I am planning to pick up this book (authored by Robert Wright) which seems to have very positive reviews overall. Any views/reviews from this subreddit?
Buddhism,"No Self, The Mind And Others","I understand *no self* and non-dualism. I understand everything is Mind—a table exists as a table with the label *table* within my mind. To an alien landing on earth that object that I see as a *table* would be meaningless to it. Same thing with roads, walls, and almost everything we have formed and molded and labeled, as human beings. 

Then I started to think about others and about how we only have a mental image, an idea, of an individual person based on subjective experiences and memories of said person. Who we see them as and think they *are* exists only in our minds. They themselves have a *self image* and view themselves one way, which doesn't necessarily correlate at all with how others view them. We can never really know someone unless we can step inside their bodies, correct? So all we have is a subjective mental image and narrative of everyone else, that oftentimes doesn't even correspond with how they see themselves. So your mother, father, whoever you have loved have existed only in your mind. Everyone you have ever encountered has only ever existed in your mind. 

The mind is like a mirror and all that we view as an independent, lasting self is just smoke and mirrors, just reflections. This body isn't us—the aggregates eventually dissolve, sooner or later. We are only a compilation of aggregates telling itself a narrative that it thinks will never end. When the *self* dissolves, the narrative dissolves. The *self is* the narrative.

Buddhism,Abhijñā vs. jñāna,"The following passage from the ārya-akṣayamati-nirdeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra (""The Noble Mahayana sutra called 'Akṣayamati's Instruction'""), section 173A-173B, discusses the difference between abhijñā (""clear cognition"") and jñāna (""gnosis"").

It seems from this passage that abhijñā consists of cognition of relative truth, whereas jñāna consists of cognition of ultimate truth.

The excerpt begins with the tail-end of a list of the 16 aspects of the meditation [dhyāna] which is characteristic of bodhisatvas.

___

...[14.] Because they always abide in equipoise, the bodhisatvas' meditation [dhyāna] is even.

[15.] Because the Buddha perfects all dharmas, the bodhisatvas' meditation is the gnosis [jñāna] that masters all dharmas.

[16.] Because the nature of gnosis is open, the bodhisatvas's meditation pervades space.

&amp;nbsp;

Honourable Sharadvatiputra, this is the consummation of meditation [dhyāna-pāramitā] of the bodhisatvas, endowed with sixteen aspects. It is not found in śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas.

&amp;nbsp;

What, then, is the meditation training [dhyana-paricaya]? It is the perfection of clear cognition [abhijñā] and gnosis [jñāna].

What is clear cognition and what is gnosis? To see all appearances as form is called ""clear cognition"". To know the dharmatā of all form to be indestructible and to realize the indestrutible dharma is called ""gnosis"".

&amp;nbsp;

Apprehending all noise as [intelligible] sounds is ""clear cognition""; knowing the origin and end-point of sound as inconceivable is ""gnosis"".

Knowing the deeds of all sentient beings is ""clear cognition""; knowing the mind to *be* cessation instead of bringing about the mind's cessation is ""gnosis"".

Mindfulness of the origin and end-point is ""clear cognition""; knowlege without attachment to the three times is ""gnosis"".

Entering the field of all Buddhas is ""clear cognition""; knowing the field to be like space is ""gnosis"".

Desiring the inseparable dharma is ""clear cognition""; perceiving all dharmas to be equal is ""gnosis"".

The characteristic of the inseparability of all worlds is ""clear cognition""; unmuddled knowledge of the dharmas of the world is ""gnosis"".

Overpowering Shakra and Brahma and  the lokapalas is ""clear cognition""; knowledge which is ahead of [i.e. surpasses] all sravakas and pratyekabuddhas is ""gnosis"".

Honourable Sharadvatiputra, those comprise the meditation training of the bodhisatvas.

Buddhism,Ngakpa teachers?,"Hey all, already posted this in r/vajrayana but thought I should post here too. in short, I'm heavily interested in the ngakpa tradition and am looking if its the right path for me, so I need to get in contact with ngakpa teachers, the problem is I only know one, Pema Khandro, and I don't particularly like her teachings on gender or feminist thinking, so she's not the one for me. I can't actually find any ngakpas that arent involved with her organization that are giving teachings, so I'm coming to you guys to see if you know of any ngakpa teachers I could get in contact with.

Buddhism,The Bodhisattva Vows,"There are a number of versions of this vow, taken by Mahayana Buddhists - I like this one:

**Living beings are innumerable: I vow to save them.**   
**Delusive passions are inexhaustible: I vow to extinguish them.**   
**The Dharma gates are immeasurable: I vow to master them.**   
**The Way of the Buddha is unsurpassable: I vow to fulfill it.**   


Other versions/translations can be found here

[https://terebess.hu/zen/szoto/vows.html](https://terebess.hu/zen/szoto/vows.html)  


I just wanted to share the vow: I think it is beautiful and was daydreaming about a world in which all people had taken the vow. In my own life, I often wonder from the path, and the vow helps me to refocus and remind me what I should be doing with my life.  


I think the vows also hammer home just how ambitious Buddhism really is: even when the suffering of our lives and the world seems infinite, you can have the strength, courage and intention to eliminate it.

With Christmas nearing, I thought I could slide in a book along with the rest of her gifts. I’m looking for something unassuming. I don’t want her to feel like I’m trying to force her down any path, more so just trying to ease some of the suffering by removing some of the ignorance around the subject. Any recommendations would be appreciated, as googling is really only bringing up howto books on how to date as a buddhist or have a relationship as a Buddhist. 

Edit: just to clear some things up. I have no intention of converting her. More so just want her more comfortable with the fact that her SO is a Buddhist. Brought up going on a retreat the other day and she didn’t enjoy to thought of not being able to talk to her spouse for 10 days. I just don’t want her to worry about losing her spouse to a religion.

Buddhism,New Practicing Buddhist,"Hello everyone!

Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this.

I come from a big Christian family. I may be one of the few people in my family to fall off the radar. For years I've been fascinated by Buddhism and have always thought about converting. As of now, I would consider myself to be transitioning still but that is simply because I have no idea how to officially convert. The nearest Buddhist temple is 2 hours away from where I live and I am not familiar with any of them. I also have no idea if other Buddhist communities would be willing to accept me. I've only been studying the basic scriptures of Buddhism but I don't know which branch of Buddhism I should officially join. I am Filipino with Japanese ancestry and so I might be leaning to Nichiren, Shingon, or Zen Buddhism. 

As of now, I really just need some advice as a ""newbie"". What should I do, not do? What type of rituals or ways should I begin practicing? What do I do when I visit a temple?

Thank you to anyone willing to help me out a bit..."

Buddhism,Emptiness and Dependent Arising - Dilgo Khyentse,"Phenomena adorn emptiness, but never corrupt it. If you have a thorough understanding of the way phenomena appear through dependent arising, it will not be difficult for you to understand the view of emptiness while remaining in meditation. On arising from such a meditation and entering the path of action, you will recognize clearly the direct relationship between actions and their results. This will enable you to discriminate easily between positive and negative actions.

Buddhism,Beautiful moment,"Hey y’all. I’m not a serious practicing Buddhist, but I had a moment the other day that you might find interesting. So I started my journey into Buddhism with The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying. I read through most of the meditation sections but never really felt like I grasped the idea of meditation until...

I had just finished a yoga class, and during the shavasana, I stared at the ceiling with my eyes open. I started to imagine myself sitting at the edge of a pond, watching the pond ripple like thoughts in my mind. Eventually I realized that the pond in my mind was the really just the same as the ceiling I was staring at, and I started to feel like I understood the beauty of observing the stillness of the mind. For me the key was to just observe, and not try to do anything other than breathe. It was a nice feeling, to just observe stillness with my eyes and mind. 

I guess the point I’m making is that small realizations on the nature of the mind can happen at any moment, and sometimes you will just realize that you observing something beautifully still and calm. 

Lastly, if anyone recommends any other cool books to has any stories to share, go ahead!

For example, I will be doing something or I  will make a suggestion and I feel like she's constantly shitting on me. Now, it maybe seems like she's the problem  but I feel this  with  everyone. If I sense someone , in my mind, thinks I don't know something or  am stupid or whatever, I immediately get angry. Or like in public. I get enraged if people just do small things like not say excuse me or not say thank you if I hold the door or something. If I act on these feelings, by being snippy or making a comment, I immediately feel embarrassed of myself.

Buddhism,Wake-up by Bodhidharma,"&gt; #Wake-up Sermon

&gt; **The essence of the Way is detachment.** 
 **And the goal of
those who practice is freedom from appearances.** The sutras say,
""Detachment is enlightenment because it negates appearances.""
Buddhahood means awareness. Mortals whose minds are aware
reach the Way of Enlightenment and are therefore called buddhas.
The sutras say, ""Those who free themselves from all appearances
are called buddhas."" The appearance of appearance as no appearance can't be seen visually but can only be known by means of
wisdom. Whoever hears and believes this teaching embarks on the
Great Vehicle and leaves the three realms.
The three realms are greed, anger, and delusion. To leave the
three realms means to go from greed, anger, and delusion back to
morality, meditation, and wisdom. Greed, anger, and delusion have
no nature of their own. They depend on mortals. And anyone
capable of reflection is bound to see that the nature of greed, anger,
and delusion is the buddha-nature. Beyond greed, anger, and delusion there is no other buddha-nature. The sutras say, ""Buddhas
have only become buddhas while living with the three poisons and
nourishing themselves on the pure Dharma."" The three poisons are
greed, anger, and delusion. 
The Great Vehicle is the greatest of all vehicles. It's the conveyance of bodhisattvas, who use everything without using
anything and who travel all day without traveling. Such is the
vehicle of buddhas. The sutras say, ""No vehicle is the vehicle of
buddhas.""
Whoever realizes that the six senses aren't real, that the five
aggregates are fictions, that no such things can be located
anywhere in the body, understands the language of buddhas. The
sutras say, ""**The cave of five aggregates is the hall of zen.** The
opening of the inner eye is the door of the Great Vehicle."" What
could be clearer?
**Not thinking about anything is zen.** Once you know this,
walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, everything you do is zen.
To know that the mind is empty is to see the buddha. The buddhas
of the ten directions have no mind. To see no mind is to see the
buddha.

""Remember consciously with a clear and relaxed mind, without judging, all the actions of body, speech and mind carried out in the last day/week/year.

Rejoice in all the positive actions. It is likely one finds more to rejoice in than one initially thinks.

Now focus inward and identify your qualities, finding at least one. 

Rejoice in your qualities, ideally until the thought ""I am good"" is generated.

Repeat this method until the thought ""I am good"" is generated naturally.

To counteract self-absorption, rejoice regularly in the fortune of others.""

..this includes persons who unwittingly were very detrimental and destructive to my life

....does that mean that if I use certain words which they used 'not caring-ly' (ex.want, right, wrong) that if I use those words I will gradually 'be no better than them'/like them

Buddhism,"A beginner, and struggling with the First Noble Truth","Hello, I'm new to all of this, but my therapist has taught me the Four Noble Truths and has suggested me to reflect on the First: **there is dukkha**. I've understood that the notion of dukkha covers feelings from mild irritation, to sadness, to anger and grief. I have a problem with anger, righteousness and desire for revenge and I'm aware that I have to work on it. But I don't know if I'm handling the First Noble Truth correctly. I mean, okay pain is a universal experience and I have to accept and embrace it... but does this mean that I have to be passive and let people do horrible things to me? *(I am a sexual abuse survivor).* 

Honestly I'm not ready, and I probably never will be ready, to see pain as good and acceptable. I think that people should get angry and fight back if someone mistreats them or breaks moral laws. In my experience, anger can also be a good thing because it helps us generate the energy to fight injustice: if black people in the US hadn't been angry about racial discrimination, today there wouldn't be equality of rights. If feminists hadn't been angry, there wouldn't have been vote for women... In my country, if socialist and liberal partisans hadn't been angry against fascists, we would still have Fascism. You get the point. So I don't think that we should ""accept"" suffering... but maybe I'm missing something. 

However I trust my therapist so I'm sure there is something I am missing in my interpretation. Where am I wrong? "
Buddhism,Meaning of snakes and darkness in Buddhism,"I have asked before about seeing things while meditating, however I basically new what I was seeing as I saw it, because I saw myself. This was completely different it was almost like I was watching an entire scene, in one quick image.

&amp;#x200B;

There was a white snake wrapped around a ball of blackness. The snake kept trying to bite at the orb, but only bite itself. I  could sense the hatred flowing from the snake as it at itself more and more and eventually the snake turned black and the orb turned white.

&amp;#x200B;

Could this be my subconscious reminding me that hate and anger are by there very nature are destructive. As I said before I could kind of get impressions off of the snake, but the orb was not sentient. It was anger that initially moved the snake to stop its opponent, but as that anger solidified into hatred it became the darkness it tried to avoid.

If this is so then what is the meaning of the orb turning white?"

Buddhism,Questions,"Hi all, just some thoughts which would be nice to bounce off some one else. I understand that I skim over a handful of different points, so I'm sorry if it requires too much in an answer, but it would be useful to get a viewpoint on some one more experienced than myself.

Since I've been reading up on Buddhism, and trying to practice, I've definitely noticed how much its benefited me, in terms of awareness, mindfulness and compassion, most of all. Living in the here and now has been a game changer for me, and paying attention to what is going on, as an observer, rather than getting caught up in the rhetoric is very helpful. I also just feel a lot more compassionate towards myself and to others. Even after sitting! Just from paying attention to my mind and breathing, I feel like helping my parents out around the house, trying to lighten their load. Or I feel like texting some one I care about to tell them how much I love them. It's crazy how it works. 

But once I start reading up on more of the nuances of Buddhism, thats when I start to get confused, and maybe a little jaded. The doctrine of no-self is a tough one to get my head around, but I understand it, in a sense. The only thing is, who am I supposed to be giving compassion to if my identity isn't 'fixed'? I'm known me my whole life, and I've come to love and respect myself. This doctrine kind of makes me feel a little sad because it's as if I'm saying bye to myself because I was never truly real in the first place. 

I also read up on the teachings of emptiness, and it makes me feel a little 'empty' myself to be honest. The world lacks any kind of inherent meaning, most the time I'm okay with this, but sometimes I think to myself, we're just meaningless organisms floating on this rock through space. What's the point of even trying?

I also love my family very much, especially my siblings. I would say that I'm probably very attached to them. If anything happened to them I'd be completely devastated. I don't want to relinquish any kind of connection or attachment or connection that I have with them, because it's what makes them special to me. Buddhist teachings like to express how everything is impermanent and will soon fade away. To be honest, a lot of the time, I'd rather not think about this! It makes me feel sad. Isn't it better to just enjoy your time with your treasured company and possessions without thinking of it/them fading. It reminds me of the saying 'better to have loved and lost, than to never have loved at all'. 

Apart from that, the only other things that confuse me are the teachings on rebirth and karma. But I mostly just put them aside and focus on the here and now, and compassion. I definitely won't be able to grasp those teachings until I have a lot more understanding. Plus, if I spend too much time pondering on that, it makes me doubt and question whether I'm following a path that leads to nowhere. "

This time, for the first time in my life, I experienced it being completely quiet. No thinking at all, not even about the breath, yet being completely alert and aware.

And there was this amazing feeling of energy and peace at the same time. The only thing I can compare it to is that feeling right after an orgasm where you release all tension and just feel good, though without the restless feeling of wanting more of it, and without actually being aware of the body.

Of course, I somehow snapped out of it as suddenly as I snapped into it. Yet a feeling of joy and wellbeing persists.

Buddhism,Very forgetful,"Hi, this is my first time posting to this sub. It's really helped me on my path. So for that I'm very grateful. 

So I've been looking into Buddhism for about a year and a half now. Started from having depression and wanting a natural way to deal with it. I found ajahn Brahms YouTube channel and watched as many topics I could find. For the first year I was learning and I felt like I was growing and generally getting better. My mental health was so much better and I felt like I could even help people that were in my situation. I felt good and like nothing in the world could knock me off this path. 

Then around summer time this year it all started to fall apart. I was becoming increasingly anxious in the mornings. As soon as I woke I wouldn't wanna go work or leave the bed in fact. This would lead to me not going to work and then feeling bad about myself. All the negative self talk untill I finally went to work. Then I noticed that I couldn't remember properly. So for example I would read a good teaching or watch a video that I felt like I learned from. Then the next morning I would wake up and it wouldn't mean a thing to me. Though the night before I felt like a connection to this words. In the morning the connection wasn't there. Just words. I write notes. I just call them my spiritual notes. Now it's got so bad that I will have a thought and then it will disappear before I can write it down. But I always believe that the thought I had was going to help me get to the next step on my path. But since I forgot what I wanted to write I just start trying to remember what I wanted to write. This always leads to frustration and more confusion. Then a sadness, a feeling like I'm going back or that everything I've learnt I don't really know atall. 

So I suppose my question is what should I do ? About waking up with anxiety and how can I remember the Buddhist teachings better ?

Thanks for reading and even as I read back I kinda can see I'm over thinking this. But it's something I just can't seem to help.

Buddhism,Unsure of where to begin my study,"I have been studying Buddhism for a number of years, starting with classes in college and then branching off of that, mostly into Mahayana, but some into Therevada and Vajrayana.  I am starting to take practice more seriously, but I feel that my study this far has been less than cohesive, studying where my interest took me rather than following a more structured plan from a teacher.  Does anyone have any suggestions on where to start again, and/or how to bring my study together? 

Additionally, there are (from what I can tell) no teachers near me within 2 hours drive distance.  Is it normal to travel more than that to meet with them?  And if not, how should I go about receiving further instruction with this geographic issue in mind?

TL,DR: noob looking for where to begin study and how to progress afterwards despite geographic constraints. "

Buddhism,Absolute versus Relative,"Does anyone have any recommendation for teachings/books that delve into the absolute and the relative?  For example, we are taught that ultimately there is no birth or death (absolute), but in our current state (relative), we experience loss and sadness associated with the “death” of someone we love.  Ultimately we must apply buddhism to our actual experiences.  Other examples- there is no separate self, yet we experience meditation through our experience of a self.  There is no good or bad, yet we strive toward certain ideals such as mindfulness and experience these as “good”.  I would love to dive into some teachings that explore how we begin to understand these absolute teachings and apply them to our actual experiences when we are as of yet un-enlightened."
Buddhism,"In a sense, we're homesick for our true nature. — Mingyur Rinpoche","Don't stop until you get back hOMe. Buddha did not 'destroy' the Vedas, he realized the teachings so perfectly that the concept of separation, or Maya, was gone completely. Maya was also his mother's name and she passed a week after his birth. I don't think this is just a 'casual coincidence'. 

I just reread the 'Self' chapter in the Dhammapada and I sincerely believe that many Westerners have misunderstood the doctrine of 'non-self' to mean that the Atman doesn't exist at all. Buddha's words seem to be saying 'why don't you see for yourself by practicing instead of intellectualizing?'.

I know this to be true in my heart above all else. If your experience contradicts this, I'd like to know.

A commenter who would like to anonymous sent me this: 

&gt; The atman is the Tathagatagarbha. All beings possess a Buddha Nature: this is what the atman is. This atman, from the start, is always covered by innumerable passions (klesha): this is why beings are unable to see it.

edit: all of the comments missed the key phrase ""IN MY HEART"". This is not an intellectual or rational excercise. There is a reason Buddha was so careful with his wording around atheism, theism and non-self/self. With enough practice, it just clicks and words really break down. "
Buddhism,How does Buddhism prevent people from being abused by their parents?,"It seems like there is a Buddhist passage about filial piety and repaying your parents for their kindness simply because they birthed you. It seems like in the case of abusive parents, a child would only feel guiltier and more self-hatred if they grew up Buddhist, since the sutra stresses how much you owe your parents, without exception. They would learn not to protect themselves and just accept abuse.

Are there any sutras that actually protect the well being of the child or are children just supposed to treat their parents kindly and repay their parents even though their parents were terrible, manipulative people?"

Buddhism,What's the difference between analytical meditation and just thinking with awareness?,"Namaskaram 🙏

Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche, in his book *Turning Confusion into Clarity : A Guide to The Foundation Practices of Tibetan Buddhism* talks about the need for beginners to contemplate on the ""four thoughts that turn the mind -- precious human existence, impermanence, karma, and suffering"". He has also provided certain guided meditations on each of these where one is required to contemplate on these and at the same time being aware of the contemplation.

**The issue that I face** : I begin contemplating, for example on   the preciousness of my human birth, and all keeps going well right up until the moment when I become aware that I am contemplating/thinking. As soon as I recognise my awareness, either the contemplation stops or it stutters. I go back to resting my attention on my breath and begin the process again, but the same issue occurs again.

Buddhism,Self-esteem,"What does Buddhism say about self-esteem? 

As far as i know, what was looked up to were qualities of the noble ones, that there were these wholesome states that should be respected, and attained, for that matter, but nothing about feeling good about yourself so on and so forth.

I say this because it seems like a loss to forgo positive feeling and emotion. I know it's probably the whole ""it will arise and cease"" mentality, but then it seems like there's limited space to actually feel good about anything, since they are ""just feelings"".

I guess its more of a matter of disbelief than it is doubt, but still, we should be allowed to admire ourselves, and celebrate a little bit, some of the time.

Its like there's a switch that you can turn on at any moment to open the floodgates, but the only thing stopping you is that you are told that these things are attachments, even good things, and to cling to them will still create more suffering."

Buddhism,Tips for dealing with jealousy/anger/self-hatred?,"Hi again,  


I posted here last week about my mission to overcome my anger so that I can cultivate a healthy and loving relationship with my girlfriend. I'm happy to say that things are better. Significantly better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know one week isn't a very long time, but I am doing my best and I am dedicated to controlling my anger for the sake of me and my girlfriend's relationship. I am learning to embrace the thoughts that pop into my head that used to cause me jealousy and anger instead of trying to repress them. After doing this for a while, it didn't take long for me to discover that I have intense self-hatred. When angry or jealous thoughts pop up in my head, I punish myself for having them. I am causing myself pain because that is what I feel I deserve. I have made mistakes in the past and by feeding into these horrible thoughts and feelings, I was forcing myself to pay for them almost every day, even though others have been able to forgive me I was unable to forgive myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week I wrote in my journal ""Work on your relationship with yourself. Have a good relationship with yourself so you can have a good relationship to the world. Let go of bad energy and the people and events still living inside of you."" I have done my best to stay true to these words. I have tried my absolute hardest to replace my negative self-talk with compassionate self-talk. When feelings of anger or jealousy arrive I try not to punish myself like I used to by calling myself a stupid idiot, instead, I try to console myself as if I were a close friend of mine.

&amp;#x200B;

I am finding it very difficult to forgive myself. I know it will take sometime for me to be able to treat myself with compassion, because in order to do so I must overcome a lifetime habit of speaking harshly and unkindly to myself. Even now I was about to slip back into my old ways, ""you idiot, how much time you've wasted making yourself miserable!""... I must learn to forgive my past self as if I were another person. I must view myself objectively. I must learn to not focus on my mistakes, poor behaviors, bad memories, instead I must focus on the person, myself. I must learn to see the human and lovable part of myself. I need to learn to see past the shallow, scared, threatened motivators I had/have. I should not judge myself so harshly.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is a lot, but I really am just trying... Trying to deal with my anger, jealousy and self-hatred in a healthy way, for myself and for others. If anyone out there has struggled with something similar, please reach out and if you have any tips or advice, I'd love to hear it"

Buddhism,"Depression, Buddhism, and staying alive to escape reincarnation. Questions...","I've been suffering from some seriously bad depression. I'm only a teenager and for the past few months have been turning towards spirituality and buddhism for relief and purposefulness. It's helped a lot, in many ways, just not enough with my depression. I don't harm myself and haven't attempted suicide although I engage the thought of dying quite often.

My question is, in buddhist philosophy, we are all put on this earth to achieve enlightenment and strengthen/develop our jiva. Right? So could I consider everything I've gone through (things on top of depression I won't mention) obstacles to overcome to become stronger and/or learn from? And if so, why am I put through so much suffering at such an early stage in my life? Why is the universe punishing me, however enlightening my suffering may be, for something I have not done? My suffering makes it difficult for me to believe in a macrocosm that cares for an individual that consecrates themselves to doing *good* and being a good person. Where's the silver lining?

Another question/point of mine is about suicide. In buddhist theory, if I end it, would I be reincarnate into another life form, subject to the same amount of suffering? If I keep fighting 'til the end of my life, could I escape the endless vicious cycle of suffering (aka reincarnation)?

Buddhism,"There is a guru guy on Youtube who claims to understand and explain enlightenment, could I get some feedback on this?","Hi everyone. I am not a Buddhist, and I would not describe myself as spiritual of any kind, but I like to investigate and learn about how other people think.

&amp;#x200B;

If you look up stuff about enlightenment on Youtube, this video is one of the first to show up, and has hundreds of thousands of views, and seems to have an overwhelmingly positive reception.

[https://youtu.be/Bsyplaii9p4](https://youtu.be/Bsyplaii9p4)

However, there are some things about this particular video that have me quite worried.

The guy in the video claims to be talking about a profound truth that ""virtually no human beings understand"", and that the truth is spiritual enlightenment.

However, things get quite worrying at 12:49 in. There is this strange theme that pops up over and over again in the video where he really tries to get you to literally not trust your own thoughts.

He tells the listener to be skeptical about your own mind, and he warns that ""your mind will play games with you to prevent you from seeing \[the truth\]"". He talks a lot about how scary and terrible this truth will be to you, no matter who you are, then at 16 minutes in, he says ""you're going to be psychologically manipulated and sabotaged by your own psyche to prevent you from seeing this truth"".

&amp;#x200B;

Then, at 19:20, he says that ""the truth is that you don't exist. There is no such thing as you in reality"". Now I know that Buddhism has the concept of the self ultimately being empty of independent existence, but then at 20:30 he makes it clear that he is saying that you ""literally, physically"" don't exist. He makes it clear another time that everything he's saying is literal. (Also, from some other videos of his, it appears he does indeed believe literally nothing exists. He states in some of them that reality is a hallucination, that brains do not generate consciousness, but brains are a sort of trick that consciousness hallucinates.)

&amp;#x200B;

Then at 29:22 he says that ""All the fear, the suffering, all the emotional distress that you've had in your life, all the problems you've had in your life are fake. Your entire life is a pathetic excuse. Basically a pathetic escape from your true nature... Because this is how your psyche is constructed. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Then at 35:42 in he goes back to the theme of not trusting your thoughts. ""Notice that there's a voice inside your head that is saying stuff about me, about these ideas... Remember I said that 'what if your communication was flawed... it creates blind spots.' Could it be that this communication system is functioning right now on overdrive... this is \[your mind\] doing its usual thing, creating more blind spots because right now, a blind spot was exposed to you. And your psyche doesn't like seeing these things.""

&amp;#x200B;

At 1:07:10  he says ""...take a look at your emotional reactions... if you become critical of what I'm saying... you have some brilliant arguments for how to argue with me, there's no arguments here. All of those are emotional reactions, and that's the proof your looking for. The proof is in your emotional reactions. You have to start seeing at how your ego is deceiving you.""

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of the video is spent talking about how society at large is built around keeping us from seeing the truth of enlightenment, even down to our own families.

&amp;#x200B;

I bring all this up, because I find it to be extremely cult like. The constant reminders to not trust your own thoughts, preemptively telling his viewers that any objections they have are just their egos deceiving them and that these reactions already prove him right, and warning his viewers to distrust the people around them is very concerning to me, and it distresses me that there seems to be thousands of people who agree with this on Youtube (although I guess this concern is just my ego lol).

He has a video about the Zen bull paintings and references Buddhist monks through the ages, so it seems like he's influenced by Buddhist thought.

&amp;#x200B;

Could you guys clear up for me if anything in this video accurately portrays anything from Buddhist thought? Is there an idea that you need to distrust your own thoughts to see the truth? Right now I'm left with the impression that this guy has something very culty and dangerous going on, and I was under the impression that Buddhism eschewed dogma and such.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Wow this really blew up. Unfortunately, there's a lot of conflicting information. The consensus seems quite against Leo. Some here also want to defend Leo, but if I'm being honest, their defenses don't seem to grapple directly with what he says in his video, but interpreting his words to be closer to their conception of Buddhism.

That's fine, but I would prefer if you support Leo and what he's doing that you address what he's said directly, some comments here seem to be talking about something else entirely.

I asked Buddhists because as Leo admits himself, what he's saying is pretty out there. If it turned out that what he was saying had a lot of precedent in ancient practices, there might be more credibility to it, but it seems that his conception of enlightenment isn't the same as the Buddhist conception of enlightenment. This is important, because I want to know if there's any precedent to his thinking, or if he's just making it up whole-cloth.

Buddhism,Could somebody give me concrete examples of how Greek philosophy and religion influenced (Mahayana) Buddhist thought?,"I've recently been reading about Greco-Buddhism in the ancient Greco-Bactrian (256 BC - 125 BC) and Indo-Greek (180 BC - 10 AD) Kingdoms, which collectively spanned sections of modern-day Central Asia, Iran, Pakistan and India. I think it's absolutely fascinating but it's left me with some questions. Allow me to write a historical summary for those who might not know what I'm talking about. It's long, but I promise that it's actually rather profound. For those of you who know what I'm on about, feel free to skip ahead to the following paragraph!

These two kingdoms were once just one Greco-Bactrian kingdom in the region of Bactria in Central Asia, where a distinct Greek identity once formed among exiled Greek officials in the times of the Achaemenids. This only strengthened after Alexander the Great's conquests connected them to the rest of the Greek world. It turns out that these two kingdoms were once diverse trading hubs and were the link in the chain between East and West that later established the Silk Road. The founder of the Indo-Greek Kingdom - King Demetrius I - became a convert to Buddhism just as a lot of his Greek subjects did, and the religion began to mingle with Hellenism (Greek religion and culture), later spreading throughout the two kingdoms. Due to trade and the populations within their borders, cultural diversity led to Hellenism, Zoroastrianism (the pre-Islamic Persian religion), Brahmanism (the precursor to Hinduism) and Buddhism all exchanging ideas, which allegedly played a key part in establishing Mahayana Buddhism, the dominant school of Buddhism in modern-day East Asia. In fact, it was through monks from Gandhara (in modern-day Pakistan) that Mahayana Buddhism spread into Tibet and China, and later into Korea and Japan. As such, from this earlier cultural hybrid from which Mahayana descends, Greek philosophy, religion and art have left their traces all across Asia. In fact, the first anthropomorphic portrayal of the Buddha was found in Gandhara and was supposedly inspired by Greek incarnations of their deities, such as Apollo. In earlier Indian tradition, they would usually just depict him with symbols, such as the Bodhi Tree. The Buddha as you might imagine him was actually sculpted by Greeks...! To further emphasise this cultural influence, there is also artwork that shows Heracles (Hercules) as the protector of the Buddha, and it's thought that this artwork may have inspired incarnations of Vajrapani - one of the Bodhisattvas of Mahayana Buddhism - and his later Japanese incarnation, Shukongōshin. It's profound to consider just how much cultural exchange had been going on in even those days, and - to me - is a brilliant example of dependent origination and why we shouldn't make such strict distinctions with our definitions.

However, this has left me with some questions. Of course, it wasn't just Hellenism that influenced Buddhism; this also happened the other way round. I found an example of how Buddhism influenced Hellenism and our modern Western philosophy by inspiring some of Pyrrhus' ideas of skepticism, after he visited Bactria. I've found examples of how Greek art influenced Buddhist art and how Greek mythology lent its influence to the pantheon of Mahayana Buddhism (as shown above), but I've not been able to find any other concrete examples of how Greek philosophy or religion influenced Buddhism - or Mahayana Buddhism, namely. In other words, what Greek influences played a major role in forming Mahayana Buddhism which sets it apart from earlier Theravada Buddhism? What do modern-day Mahayana practitioners still practise or believe that is - in fact - a trace of this ancient Greek influence?

If anybody can provide some insight into these questions or perhaps even elicit how Zoroastrian or Brahmanic ideas may also have influenced Buddhism, I'd be very interested! In fact, if you've any more examples of how Buddhism, Zoroastrianism or Brahmanism might have influenced Greek culture, I'd also be very interested! 

Have a nice day, everyone."
Buddhism,Impatience and Frustration At Work,"I get annoyed easily at work. I talk to almost 200 people a day at a call center, and their lack of investment in their own healthcare really burns my biscuits. They can't tell me who their doctor is, what department they see here or sometimes what they need; I have to do a lot of digging to even get into the meat of the call. They argue with me about things they know nothing of, and insist I'm wrong when I've been here 5 years and deal with the whole milieu 40 hours a week. 

The details are unimportant, sufficed to say that patience is something I lack. I don't show it to them, of course, as being professional and polite is important, but I certainly hang up the phone and mutter under my breath. Or, when someone is particularly nasty to me, I might vent about it later when I get home, as part of shaking off my day. 

It's temporary. I deal with it and I feel frustrated and I wipe the slate clean and move on, but it's the nature of my job and so it repeats itself every day. 

I feel guilty about this because this is not loving behavior that I know I should exhibit as someone trying to align themselves with Buddhist principles. I feel like I should be happily helping these people and then letting any snags go like water off a duck's back, with no emotional reaction. Or, maybe that's unrealistic. I don't know.

Any advice? "
Buddhism,The 3 Impossibles of Buddha,"Aloha friends,

I was talking to a lecturer in a White Era Cultivator temple and he mentioned the idea of the 3 Impossibles of Buddha along with the 3 Possibles (if I remember correctly). One of the 3 impossibles is that Buddha (God, Dao) cannot stop the cycle of karma. Another was that Buddha cannot end the life of the living, essentially that Buddha does not interfere with the causality of the physical realm. I forgot the last impossible as well as all the ""possibles"" of Buddha he mentioned.

I was wondering if anyone is familiar with this concept, because this was the first time I heard of this idea. I searched Google, but could not find anything related. If there is a Wikipedia article or a website that someone can point me to, which I can read more thoroughly, that would be excellent!

Mahalo!

Edit: I may have just remembered the last ""impossible"" of Buddha. I believe he said that Buddha cannot give instant enlightenment to conscious beings. Essentially, each conscious being must walk that path themselves."

I don't want to switch to shaktism because I simply think Buddhism is true and that abandoning the Dharma has several drawbacks for me karmically or otherwise.I have never been happier than in Buddhism.buddhism has made the best out of me.coming from abrahamic background a religion that teaches something as profound as the bodhisattva path,metta and the door for repentance being always open is heaven to me.omnipotent omnibenevolent entities that love me unconditionally is comfort for my mind.like an army of the cosmos resdy to support me!

But I think my mindset would benefit greatly from having a goddess .

There are the wisdom dakinis but I don't know if you can really work with them without tantric empowerment.there is samantabhadri as the feminine Shakti aspects of the dharmakaya.

Maybe it's foolish of me to seek goddess devotion in a typical theist sense but I think it would bring out a change in my thinking and energies.

Any help would be appreciated.and yes there is guanyin but I would like to hear of any alternate recommendations.Tara seems very good but alot of that needs powerments.

Buddhism,Struggling with lack of desire and meaning.,"I started on a spiritual self-journey about 4 years go and found myself really captivated by a lot of Buddhist philosophy. I’ve always been a very simple and content person. While trying to observe my desires and experimenting with an incredibly minimalist lifestyle I found that there were very few things that I desire at all. I’ve also had a hard time shaking a pessimistic nihilism. Rationally I can think through how one can be liberated by meaninglessness and pressure to pursue desires, and can enjoy the freedom to create their own meaning, yet emotionally I feel empty, with little to no goals or ambitions, and crushed beneath the weight of a pointless, boring, and unfulfilling existence. 

Has anyone else struggled to make peace with these feelings while accepting the known nature of the existence? Have I missed or misinterpreted something from Buddhism that might help with these feelings? 

TLDR: I fear I’ve missed/misinterpreted something while discovering Buddhism that has lead me to struggle with a lack of desire, meaning, and existential fulfillment/satisfaction. "
Buddhism,Dharma Talk: Mindfulness of Race (Ruth King),
Buddhism,"There's a social justice orientation groups at a Zen Center in the Boston Area. However, the two groups, one for POC and the other for white people, go their separate ways at the conclusion. This seems like an insensitive tongue-in-cheek joke to me.","I've visited this [Zen temple in the Boston area recently.](https://cambridgezen.org/meditation-groups/) There are quite a few nice people there and people who want to do nice things and learn about meditation. 

Anyways, this Zen Center has created two meditation groups: 

* [Black, Indidenous, and POC Meditation Group](https://cambridgezen.org/diversityinitiative/bipoc)
* [Unpacking Whiteness Group](https://cambridgezen.org/diversityinitiative/unpackingwhiteness) 

They meet at the same place and at the same time once a month for 35 minutes from 7:30 PM - 8:05 PM. However, everyday this Zen coop does meditation at that time in which you just meditate. There's no talking, and no interactions. Just sitting meditation. So these two groups simply attend this regular meditation event without any interaction. 

However, **at the conclusion of this meditating, the two groups go their separate ways: The Black, Indigenous, and POC group goes to one room, and the ""Unpacking Whiteness Group"" goes to another portion of this Zen temple.** Instead of congregating together and discussing this social justice issue of racism, there seems to be a great wall which segregates the two groups. 

This initiative is very new for this Zen Center, and perhaps they'll make some mistakes which they'll improve upon later on. But for some reason, I feel uncomfortable about this whole segregating of the races (which is exactly what it is) and stifling of mutual understanding.

Buddhism,Some weekly mess of thoughts on Nihilism and Buddhism,"I'm only discovering buddhism and have crashed into this huge sense of nihilism (like many others, as I've noticed). I guess the problem arises to many westerners, because buddhist worldview has so many negations, rejections of things we used to take for granted. It looks like buddhism makes you to drop our natural ""meaning of life""-related aspects such as notions of ambition, achievment, striving, success, fulfilment of dreams etc etc. And the most important one, the notion of the Self, the soul.   


Everything is ever changing projection, emptiness and suffering. I've read somewhere that when Buddha awoke from samsara all he saw was an infinite fire. There is no interest in God that we used to think is the source or the condition of all reality and meaning. All appearance is but delusion. Yet buddhism, though emphasises the deceitfulness of appearance, unlike the thought of Plato and all subsequent religious-philosophical-scientific western tradition, doesn't search for some kind of certain, unchangeable knowledge about The Real or The Good or The Ideal. No thing is permanent. And there are no ultimate categories or differences to things. No point in complex 500 year discussion on the relationship between the object and the subject. Because in buddhism you actually want to see that there's no difference, no object-subject duality. All these notions are conceptually fabricated obstacles for reaching some kind of liberation from them all. We are used to clinging. I guess we could even say, that from the buddhist point of view, all religious or metaphysical systems and ideas about the meaning are just different ways of clinging, or deluding one's perception about the nature of reality and one's purposeful existence in the world. Seems like what buddhists seek is the exact opposite of what people usually want from their lives -- they try to leave nothing behind, no impact, no mark of existence since otherwise they would've contributed to karma and would indulge to the cycle of reincarnation again.

&amp;#x200B;

And all that was and still is rough to digest, as least for me. Sometimes I get a deep sense of vacuity and absurd. Yet somehow real buddhists never reacted to it's conclusions in despair - quite the opposite - they look like (and probably are) the calmest human beings in the world. What I've realised so far, is that buddhism doesn't stop at negation or absolute skepticism. It is different way of looking at *matters* (here I'm struggling to find the proper word, lol) altogether. It actually never rejected anything directly, in a sense of being naturally involved in some sort of discourse, polemics against some religion, philosophical system or ideology. Buddhism neither interfere nor does it have any interest in discussion on the matters and concepts such as meaningful existence, morality, God, Ideas, knowledge... Its like some sort of invisible undercurrent one could follow. So far, the closest thing I've discovered in western thought is the method of *phenomenology*, which is about studying the *conscious experience* first and foremost and holding any premises or judgements and about the objective reality. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are lots of aspects of buddhism which I don't have a firm grasp of. The concepts of karma and reincarnation seems especially troublesome. And I understand it's not all about understanding the worldview intellectually and that it has lots to do with feeling it, practicing. I do try meditate (started to read *The Mind Illuminated*), yet I still feel some sort of need to properly integrate the thought intelectually,  since the huge difference between the adopted western worldview and buddhist thought causes me that nihilistic sense from time to time.   


So that's that for now. Thank you for reading, if you have any remarks on my mess of thoughts, I'd be glad to receive a feedback. "

Buddhism,Namkhai Norbu on Guru Rinpoche’s Seven Line Prayer,"Edit: Namkhai Nyingpo, not Namkhai Norbu. My mistake.

Teaching on Seven Lines Prayer 

Namkhai Nyingpo Rinpoche  

If one can concentrate on practising the (seven lines prayer) in this life, when you die you will dissolve into the mind of Guru Rinpoche. Guru Rinpoche is the ultimate nature of the embodiment of all Buddhas. In Guru Rinpoche’s termas, it is written that in the degenerated times, Guru Rinpoche’s compassionate blessings are swifter than that of other Buddhas. In this life, if you wish your body to be free from sickness or pain, pray to Guru Rinpoche and you will receive his protection. If you seek for wealth, longevity or wish to clear your obstacles, just by praying, all wishes can be fulfilled. Some people think that to practice Guru Rinpoche for wealth is of no use, but this is not correct. Just by relying upon Guru Rinpoche, all wishes can be achieved.

Guru Rinpoche once said, “Accomplishing me is the same as accomplishing all Buddhas; seeing me is the same as seeing all Buddhas.” In any case, Buddha Shakyamuni, Amitabha, the Eight Vidhydharas, the Eight Mahasiddhas are no different from Guru Rinpoche. Therefore, if one wishes for attainments, then the sole method is Guru Yoga. There is no other way. Therefore, at all times, focus on the Seven Lines Prayer and supplicate Guru Rinpoche. This will have infinite benefits for this and future lives, there is no doubt about it.

If one cannot practice other methods, just practising the seven-lines prayer is the same as a panacea that can cure all kinds of sicknesses. But if one is merely mouthing the prayers, it is not enough, one should have great faith and devotion to Guru Rinpoche and supplicate one-pointedly, then you are sure to receive Guru Rinpoche’s blessings and accomplishments. In the past up till the present, many great masters and practitioners have seen Guru Rinpoche directly. These are the best signs. The middling signs are to have good experiences arising. The lesser signs are to meet Guru Rinpoche in dreams and to receive prophecies and blessings from Guru Rinpoche. Just listening and contemplating the Dharma is not enough to attain liberation. Besides that, one has to practice. The three (listening, contemplation, practice) must be combined. When we are practising, we should rely on one deity. It is just like in the past, Nagarjuna and Shantideva had yidams they relied upon. In this manner, single-mindedly praying to Guru Rinpoche and merge your mind with Guru Rinpoche’s wisdom mind. This way of progressing on the path to liberation has less difficulties and obstacles. With total confidence and faith in Guru Rinpoche, not just with faith and sincerity, but believing that in any moment, Guru Rinpoche will never deceive or let us down. We must have the faith that Guru Rinpoche and our root teacher is inseparable and no different. Rely on this faith to practice.  

As our present root teacher has a very close connection to us, we are able to see our root teachers frequently. Therefore, their blessings enter our minds very swiftly. In the past, there was a Khamtrul Rinpoche. In his practice experience, he came to Guru Rinpoche’s pureland where many Dakas and Dakinis welcomed him and escorted him to see Guru Rinpoche. At that time, he wondered how Guru Rinpoche would look like. But when he came to the celestial palace, sitting on the throne was his own root master. The Dakas and Dakinis told him that the person sitting on the throne was Guru Rinpoche. This shows that Guru Rinpoche is no different from our root master. I hope everyone would be able to practice the Dharma correctly.

It normally goes along the line of...they were out doing walking meditation or sitting meditation and a wild animal wanders into their path and it is totally unconcerned with the monk and the animal moves on.

This seems to be one of the first biggest hurdles of fear a forest monk has to overcome(that I am aware of)

Are there any stories in the pali that elaborate or talk on this subject? I'm very interested in understanding how monks are able to pacify dangerous animals with only their presence."

Yet I am sad to see the woman who cared for me as a boy to be waning from this world, from this body...

As a family, we are frustrated with the cycle of changing nurses who seem to always be too busy for her. We do the best we can to take care of her needs but we need their help. 

I feel she has been given too many painkillers, she is just dazed today and sleeping with her eyes open. I feel my father is being too aggressive with physical therapy. No one is listening to me when I noticed by mindful observation we should be more patient with her, she is very frail and she is clearly in a lot of pain. She told me that she needs a rest but no one listened to me when I told them.

I feel very conflicted inside. What she told me is what I sensed, yet no one wants to listen to me since I am only 28 and the youngest, most uneducated. Yet, I am the only one who asked her 'where does it hurt most?' 'are you feeling okay?'.

I put my Buddha statue (that I take with me on every trip as my companion) in her room, I whisper words of the Devas and the Buddhas to her for comfort and strength. She used to read the Gita to me as a boy when she bathed me. She would tell me to recite 'Rama, Rama' if I am afraid and I won't be. She lit a diva for me every single day when I left home to continue my journey for Buddhahood. She would ennoble to continue if I ever got discouraged by the rest of my family tree (she is the eldest of all her siblings and the matriarch of a family forest). Our bond is unique, she would always tell me this in private too.

I am only 28, I am about to turn 29. Now, more than ever I feel the Four Noble Truths down to every atom and cell of the body I am wearing. What is all this but a stirring to awaken from this dream? 

Around me are also my one-year-old niece and three-year-old nephew. They just came into the world and I can see the purity of their innocence becoming waded down by the conditioning of the adults. They will have to go through what I did in their own way, on their own terms. I can't do anything for them but be an example. 

I don't want to be a husband, a parent, a householder, a teacher, a guru, a leader, a master, anything. I just feel the suffering and know the only path for me is to serve all beings. Nothing else adds up, nothing else can be subtracted except ego (working on this). What good is a label or a title when all that begins will also end? "

Buddhism,Consistency: Shifting From Reactivity to Pro-activity,"Just an insight I was pondering with in practice.

**We suffer in reactivity while we do not suffer when in proactivity.** 

##Samsara

There is a current of habits, almost like a gushing river, each wave coming endlessly, coming from the subconscious mind, as well as the collective minds of people around us.

Examples of such habits are: Reacting when we lose something we love, reacting when we gain something we dislike, reacting when something seemingly permanent dies, reacting when something seemingly non-existent takes birth, reacting when something changes and decays due to conditions.

The Buddha declared that this world had eight worldly conditions:

* Gain and Loss

* Fame and Disgrace

* Praise and Blame

* Pleasure and Pain

Therefore, this world cannot depart from these eight shifting conditions. When we cling onto praise, we react to its loss and to blame. When we cling onto pleasure, we react to emerging pain. When we gain something, we want it forever and react to its loss.

##Habitual Forces in the World

As mentioned above, we could use the analogy of a river, consistently gushing, torrent by torrent. Most people are not aware of it, so they live their lives from birth to death without knowing that they were carried around by these habitual forces.

For example, when a trend appears in society, you suddenly see how quickly people pick up the trend, becoming ""copy-cats"". It is like this very strange force has spread throughout the society. 

Biologists have called this a ""meme"", which means an idea that acts just like a 'living being', taking birth, growing and reproducing in minds of people, spreading throughout society. Eventually some of these memes also die out over time. Memes that are more adaptable, according to 'survival of the most adaptable', become prosperous whereas memes that are less adaptable die away.

That is an example of how that current can come from the outside. It can come from the media, the movies, your culture, what is repeated in your community, moral standards, laws, and so on. As an individual in that system, you start to be tossed around like a little boat inside a giant ocean.

##Habitual Forces in the Mind

This current of habitual forces can also come from within your own mind. Whenever we try to do something, a certain voice arises, speaking of failure, fear, pain, and more. This is what some monks call the ""Monkey Mind"".

Stay in comfort, seek pleasure, avoid pain, it says. 

Avoid hard work, take the shortcut, it says.

Procrastinate, do the work later, it says.

Don't do anything if it doesn't serve you, it says.

Me, me, me, what about me, it says.

If you notice, most of the mind's chattering is quite negative. This is a result of what we have reinforced in our minds, ever since beginningless lifetimes. 

If we reinforce positive habits, then our mind will become more positive. If we reinforce negative habits, our mind will be more negative.

However, the default state for most of us is that we remain in whatever habitual stream we are in. For most of us, it is in a pretty negative mode. With all of these negative thoughts, we remain in this default negativity repeatedly, reinforcing them. Only occasionally do we ever spring up a positive habit!

By positive habits, I mean things such as compassion, loving-kindness, joy, bliss, equanimity, tranquility, energy, diligence, and so on. This is what I mean by 'positive' - things that bring you out of suffering.

##Are We *Awake*?

As mentioned, this current does not stop. Habit after habit arises without cessation. It creates discrimination, assumptions, fantasies, narratives, biases, identity-view, and so on. It generates a myriad of problems and the worst problem is that we do not realize that we are *reinforcing* them.

**Mostly... we are asleep.**

Just like how we are mostly not aware that we are dreaming, we are also not aware that we are day-dreaming.

Just like automatic clockwork, we wake up in the morning, brush our teeth, do the exact same routines, go to work, react in the same way to things, come home, rinse and repeat. Again and again and again.

Some people never realize this. Some people realize that something is going on, and they never feel satisfied in their lives, thinking that there is something else outside of it. Others go full-rebel, trying to rebel against society. Some realize how insane this gushing current is, and decide to renounce the world.

##Mindfulness As Antidote

Mindfulness (sati in Pali) is not just some kind of prescription. Its purpose becomes crystal-clear when you see it through my explanation and description above.

When we practice mindfulness, we become mindful of four categories: 

1. Body

2. Feelings

3. Thoughts

4. Mental Qualities

But have you ever considered - *Why? Why do we have to be mindful in the first place?* 

Well, I simply took it for granted as being mindful equals to observing the impermanence of these four categories. But it seems like there is much more under-the-surface.

**The gushing current of habits takes our life into various destinies.** 

For example, if we were always miserly, stubborn, depressed and pessimistic, we wouldn't be able to make many friends. If we were spendthrifts, we wouldn't be able to save up enough money. These are all real-life examples, but it is fairly clear to see how habits determine a person's destiny.

There was a famous old saying:

&gt; Watch your thoughts for they become words,

&gt; watch your words for they become actions,

&gt; watch your actions, for they become habits,

&gt; watch your habits for they become your character,

&gt; watch your character for it becomes your destiny.

&gt; —Ralph Waldo Emerson

Therefore, if you want to have control over your own destiny, then **you need to be able to determine which habits get reinforced, and which habits do not get reinforced**. 

Mindfulness makes you alert to these habits arising. If you do not even know that these habits are guiding your life, then you will be *ignorant* of their effect on your destiny. Therefore, watch your ""castle""! 

##Mindfulness Is Not Just Alertness

The second problem is that mindfulness in the Buddhist context is not purposeless. As mentioned above, the purpose for mindfulness is to be able to choose which habits you want to reinforce, and which habits you do not want to reinforce.

If you reinforce the habits of misery, anger, shame - you make it much easier for these habits to arise in future.

If you instead reinforce the habits of loving-kindness, compassion, forgiveness, sympathetic joy, equanimity and more - you make it easier for positive habit to arise in future.

Therefore along with mindfulness as 'waking up from the day-dream', there is also a spontaneous choice to make or break a habit. 

##Changing Habits... How to?

We all know that thoughts appear and disappear like clouds in the mind. So do sensations, feelings and mental qualities. This is basic Buddhism 101.

But the question here is - how does this change habits?

In psychology, when we dissociate a stimulus and a response, over time, this connection is extinguished. However, it takes time. If a negative habit is very strong, it can take a very long time for it to be extinguished.

Anyone with an alcohol or smoking addiction problem can tell you how difficult it can be, especially with withdrawal symptoms.

Conversely, if we want to build good habits, it can also take a while for the habit to become reinforced and dominant in our lives. Some psychology experts estimate about 60 days of consistent reinforcement before it becomes natural.

So how? Do we just brute force it out?

##The Buddhist Triad For Changing Habits

The first thing we should try to do is do our best in our thoughts, words and actions. These form the basis for newly reinforced habits in the now. This is the purpose of Discipline (sila).

The next thing we need to do is to develop a form of stability to make this reactivity to habits less severe. In meditation, we still the monkey-mind over time through practice, and we are then able to rest in a relatively-stable state of mind. When practiced properly, we can even enter a state of *samadhi*. If practiced correctly, we enter *right samadhi*, which is one of the folds of the Noble Eightfold Path, going through the four dhyanas. So being able to attain a form of stability and loss of reactivity is the purpose of Meditation.

Another thing we need to do, which comes hand-in-hand with Meditation and Sila, is to develop wisdom. Mundane wisdom is learnt through reading the Dhamma, understanding the discourses and applying them to our practice. To attain supramundane wisdom, we can only do so along with our Meditation.

##What We Normally See

The first thing we need to realize is that ""The Mind is the Forerunner of Things"". 

And top of the list of those problems are habits. More Buddhist-like synonyms are ""afflictions, frustrations and fetters"". As we go along, we realize that:

*""Oh wow, the mind really has a SHIT LOAD of habits!""*

Coarse habits, subtle habits. Some of them are physical in nature, some of them are verbal in nature, some of them are mental in nature. 

As we loosen our habits to negative things, we become less attached to negativity of the world and our own minds. We also stop trying to cling onto things, or being averse to things. We stop being apathetic and ignorant of how we are being carried along in this river. We may even become disillusioned and want to renounce the world. Renounce or not, just do whatever we can. Even as a layperson, we can do *plenty*.

On a deeper level, we even lose the habit of being in the desire-realm. As we let go of deeper layers, even the habit of being in a form-realm or formless-realm vanishes through deeper meditation. 

##What we NEED to see

How do we know if we are doing things correctly? How do we know if we are practicing correctly and not lying to ourselves?

**The first key is transformation of habits.**

We need to LOSE these negative habits. We lose the addiction to smoking, alcohol or poor health habits. We lose the addiction to sex, food and sleep. We lose the addiction to ""self-oriented"" behaviour, focusing instead on helping other people.

In other words, if anyone claims to be a Buddhist, but is not transforming these habits - you can't really say he is practicing well or correctly! These habits, coarse or fine, are what keeps us in this cycle of suffering. 

Haha I don't know if you agree with this, but along with waking up in this river of habitual forces, we also need to learn how to get out of this river, not watch ourselves be washed from bank to bank, ignoring our own suffering."

Buddhism,I have read recently that rebirth and realms of existence such as God's and hungry ghosts are in no way meant to be taken litterally.,"They are simply ways of explains the different states of experience that one goes through.

Birth into anxiety or birth into a pleasurable experience.

Not in anyway supernatural...

Is this a common understanding for western Buddhists?"
Buddhism,Become untouchable.,"What lies at the very core of the Buddha's teaching, its very essence?

Only this:

**That moment when you are completely unmoved by anything and everything.**

Perfectly mindful of all, yet completely and utterly **untouchable** by all.

That is what the Buddha was trying to teach:

&gt; ‘I am one who has transcended all, a knower of all,
&gt;
&gt; Unsullied among all things, renouncing all,
&gt;
&gt; By craving’s ceasing freed. Having known this all
&gt;
&gt; For myself, to whom should I point as teacher?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; ‘I have no teacher, and one like me
&gt;
&gt; Exists nowhere in all the world
&gt;
&gt; With all its devas, because I have
&gt;
&gt; No person for my counterpart.
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; ‘For I am the arahant in the world,
&gt;
&gt; I am the teacher supreme.
&gt;
&gt; I alone am a Perfectly Enlightened One
&gt;
&gt; Whose fires are quenched and extinguished.
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; ‘I go now to the city of Kāsi
&gt;
&gt; To set in motion the wheel of Dhamma.
&gt;
&gt; In a world that has become blind
&gt;
&gt; I go to beat the drum of the Deathless.’

The Buddha was the first truly free man. Nothing in all of samsara could touch him at all. However, all other humans are bound by the world, so it is very difficult for them to understand his teachings:

&gt; Enough with teaching the Dhamma
&gt;
&gt; That even I found hard to reach;
&gt;
&gt; For it will never be perceived
&gt;
&gt; By those who live in lust and hate.
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; Those dyed in lust, wrapped in darkness
&gt;
&gt; Will never discern this abstruse Dhamma,
&gt;
&gt; Which goes against the worldly stream,
&gt;
&gt; Subtle, deep, and difficult to see.

The people who originally heard the Buddha were deeply inspired by witnessing a person who is completely free of the bonds of samsara. However, most of them failed to perceive **why** he is free and **how** to become like him. They misunderstood what they were witnessing.

They thought it had something to do with the **sangha**. Thus they congregated to form large communities in which the blind misled the blind. They got further bound by the notice and attachment to each other. They cared about their good standing in the eyes of others. Thus, they became even more embroiled in samsara and bound by the fetters of slavery.

They thought it had something to do with the **dharma**, and thus ""teachings"" proliferated like gold in the coffers of a greedy miser. If the teachings shall free us, then we must have more of them!  They collected volumes upon volumes of ""teachings"", and argued with each other about every comma and little clause. They became spiritual accountants.

They thought it had something to do with the **Buddha**, a person who was trying to teach them. So they tried to get in his good graces, by flattery, honoring him like a god, and creating a religion for him. If we pray to the Buddha and offer him some sweets, then surely he will bequeath good fortune upon us!  That is the way out of worldly suffering, right...?

&gt; With such a person, gain and loss, fame and disrepute, praise and blame, pleasure and pain keep his mind engrossed. When gain comes he is elated and when he meets with loss he is dejected. When fame comes he is elated and when he meets with disrepute he is dejected. When praise comes he is elated and when he meets with blame he is dejected. When he experiences pleasure he is elated and when he experiences pain he is dejected. Being thus involved in likes and dislikes, he will not be freed from birth, aging, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and despair; he will not be freed from suffering, I say.

As Sakyamuni Gautama predicted, they have failed to understand his teachings. Instead, they turned them around into one more shackle to the conditioned.

Here's a two word summary of the true teachings:

**Become untouchable.**

The real Buddhist teaching isn't about shrines, ceremonies, moralism, rules, rituals, lineages, institutions, traditions, teachers, objects of any kind, or intellectual learning.

The real Buddhist teaching is what allows you to be [perfectly still and unmovable as fire consumes your physical body](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c_self-immolation.jpg).

It's the heart of true liberation, where absolutely nothing can touch you.

Everything else is nonsense which generally works towards the opposite end.

So how does one do this, practically?

&gt; The weakest practitioners, understanding that phenomena are the cause of suffering break the link at contact, so they will not experience sensation. This is the function of śila, discipline. Stronger practitioners can sever the link at sensation, since they can control their craving with samadhi. The best practitioners however, can sever the link at ignorance, since they are owners of prajñā.

The most accomplished person could move through lava as if it was a cool pleasant pool. Samsara could beset him on all sides, screaming for his attention through _contact_: his nerves shrieking in pain, enticing sense impressions casting barbed hooks into his sense organs, his mind swarmed by tempting forms. Yet all of that will come to nothing. He will pass through all of this, ethereal, gentle as a dove, entirely unmoved, unfazed.

That is the one true goal of Buddhist teachings.

The second most accomplished person would at least shun contact. They would be a disciplined person. They are moving towards liberation.

Prajñā is rare, and even samadhi is tough to develop, but everyone can start at the bottom. So at the very least, a Buddhist should renounce sensual pleasures.

Think of yourself in the midst of sensual pleasure, such as from consuming a favorite delicacy. It's as if the sensual pleasure is a warm blanket, and you willingly rub yourself into the blanket, seeking to inseparably unify with it. You try to cover every part of yourself with this contact, hungrily pressing yourself into it in a desperate attempt to become one with it.

You are cultivating attachment.

Obviously, as you indulge in this behavior, you strengthen the bond between yourself and samsara, the phenomena of the contacts conditioning this pleasure.

This is the opposite of where you want to progress, if you are to become untouchable.

The first level of practice is thus to avoid contact that provokes attachment. You will not strengthen your attachment to contact if there is no enticing contact to attach to.

The second level of practice is to use mindfulness and concentration to experience the contact, noticing everything but attaching to nothing.

I'm not sure I have much wisdom yet so I won't talk about that stage.

Notice that it's very tempting for a person defiled by desire to mislead himself into thinking that he is engaging in sensual pleasure detached, while in fact he is just indulging, attached.

Thus all good practice starts with renunciation. [Thích Quảng Đức](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c) for example was an isolated hermit for three years at the early stage of his practice.

A good rule of thumb is: ""can I detach right now?"". No matter how pleasant this food, friendship, conversation, activity, or relationship is - can I just leave it unfazed?

This must not remain a mere theoretical question, since one can easily delude himself about its answer.

I explored this question earlier in life by simply walking away from various situations I felt I was becoming attached to, for no other reason than my attachment to them. You should try that, it's incredibly liberating.

That's why I follow the monastic guideline of never forming any attachment that are morally binding, such as a wife and children.

I could walk away from everything. That's why I can make posts like this, which will draw much hate from the arrogant blind and ignorant."

Buddhism,Is there anything like Stream Entry in Tibetan Buddhism?,"From what I understand, in Theravada, the experience of [stream entry](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/into_the_stream.html) seems to be given central importance. The sotāpanna (stream-enterer) is described one who has, among other things, abandoned the fetter of self-view. The meditator has a direct experience of the self and sees how is *not* a durable, unchanging entity.

&gt; Part of what makes the arising of the Dhamma eye such a powerful experience is that the realization that ""Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation"" must follow on a glimpse of what stands in opposition to ""all that is subject to origination,"" i.e., a glimpse of the Unconditioned — deathlessness.

---
Similarly, even in the very different tradition of Zen, the insight into one's own nature - [*kensho*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenshō) - is also described as a powerful, initiatory glimpse into the nature of Things As They Are, a transformative insight into self and mind that removes doubt and signals the beginning of a deeper spiritual practice.

I know it's often a mistake to try to compare Buddhist paths, but is there a similar concept in Tibetan Buddhism? Is the first glimpse of the mind's true nature thought to be a powerful sort of experience that signals spiritual progress? The closest thing I've found is in descriptions of Dzogchen, where the pointing-out instruction (the so-called Direct Introduction to the nature of mind) by one's guru seems to be regarded similarly. But of course Vajrayana is fairly secretive, and it's hard to tell whether the impact of Direct Introduction is earth-shaking in a similar way to stream entry or kensho."

Buddhism,"“Love her truly, love her all” Episode from the Autobiography of Thai forest monk Luang Pu Juan Kulachettho (1920-80) about his early adultlife attempts on fighting lustful feelings with some skilful body contemplations (Asubha)","Chapter 2 》Getting to know the love for girls《

As a layman around the age of eighteen, being in my ""wild phase"" so to speak, I fell in love with a particular girl. This girl lived in the same village and was maybe around two years younger than me, which made her sixteen at that time. But to tell you the truth, that certain girl wasn't a special beauty, just a very normal, mediocre looking girl, one might say. But what made feelings of attraction and love arise was due to the fact that every single morning this teenage girl would pass by in front of our house. She was on her daily walk towards the nearby forest grove to defecate, as it was normal in rural areas in those days to use the edges of forests and fields to relieve oneself. So it came to be, that I got to see this girl every single morning. After waking up and washing my face, I saw her walking in front of our house. And that girl, except for one piece of cloth wrapped around her waist, didn't wear anything on her upper body, fully exposing her female features. During the first few days however, on seeing her passing our house with her naked breasts, thoughts of love or attraction didn't cross my mind at all.... but alas, seeing it day-in day-out, this quite normal, familiar sight eventually, became all of a sudden, quite special, and I found myself thinking: ""Wow this girl has really beautiful breasts"". Consequently this infatuation born from the attractiveness of her breasts lead me to see the rest of her in the light of beauty - making me fall in love with all of her! 
	That startled me. I asked myself: ""A while ago I didn't perceive her as beautiful at all, feeling no love for her at all! But now I think I love her. What caused that to happen? Why is that?
 I came to the conclusion: ""It's because I fell in love with her breasts, which made me see the rest of her, her skin and complexion, also as beautiful. Hence, perceiving her beautiful all over and falling in love with her from head to toe.""
	Pondering this issue back and forth, one day the thought arose: ""Mmh, if I love her complete being, seeing her as beautiful all over, then perhaps I should go and check out that girl's pile of shit. I can see if it's also beautiful or not, something lovely, something to be infatuated with!"" Thinking like that, I waited for the right occasion to follow her one early morning into the forest thicket where she went to take a dump. As soon as she finished her business and came out, I went straight in to have a look at her fresh shitpile. But it so happened that this day a forest pig was quicker than me to the scene. When I arrived, the pig had eaten up the entire shitpile without a trace. Utterly disappointed, I returned home, not having seen anything at all. But the very next day I determined to follow her again. I told myself that this time I had to be quicker than the pig; I could not allow it to eat the shit again. So, the next morning, immediately after the girl had left her usual forest spot, I quickly rushed in from another path, and intercepted the shit-eating pig successfully. After she finished her business and returned home - totally unaware that someone had secretly been watching her - I finally went in to have a look. What I got to see was a pile of excrement of utmost filthiness. Her feces was yellowish in color, swarming with all sorts of parasitic worms, tapeworms, threadworms, some longish, some curled up - swarming all over the place. I stood there staring at it and argued with myself: 

""Come on boy,... take it! You like her, don’t you? Saying she is soooo beautiful! You don't want it? You don't love it? But if you love her whole body, you have to love her shit also, man!"" 

My heart responded: ""Aargh....iiiggh! I don't want it!""

""Why don't you want it Boy? Don't you love her? If you truly love her, you have to love her fully, with her shit and all the rest. You can't be choosy here!""

""Iiihg... I cannot love it!""

""You want it now or not? Don't you want to take a bit and love it dearly, or what?

""Iiiigh...!""

""You want to have a good smell of it, don't you?""

""Ihhh...No, I don't want it!"" my heart retorted.

""Come on man, put some of it in your jeans’ pockets, won't you?""

""Iiiigh....It's so filthy and disgusting!""

""Com' on, take a hand full and shove it in your mouth!""

""Brrrrrr...No, no, no way!""

With every thought my heart rejected the idea. After standing there for a while investigating her feces I left the forest and headed home. By the time I arrived at my house, I had come to the conclusion that no matter how beautiful, lovely and attractive a body of ours might seem, it also must have this kind of shit in it!
	However, to proof if my thinking was correct, I had to check and examine some more feces, and this time from another girl - just to be sure. This other girl also went to the same forest spot for her daily defecation. I secretly followed her in just the same way and eventually got a look at her pile of excrement. Although her shit didn't show any signs of worms, it was truly repulsive all the same. There was mucus sticking to it, and its general consistency was of a slimy, disgusting and off-putting nature. I really felt repulsed and disenchanted with all of it.
	I related this story later to some of my female friends in the village, who, ever since, gave me a new nickname: ""Dr. Shit-inspector"".
	However, my curious investigations in the field of female excrement gradually reduced the feeling of love and infatuation towards that girl until finally it completely disappeared without remainder. 
	To be honest, at that time I didn't know how this idea of inspecting female excrement came about, but on reflection from my current view it is perfectly in line with the Buddha’s Dhamma that I came across in my first Dhamma-book:

""One who sees the body as beautiful
Is one lacking in wisdom,
This body contains feces and such things,
Nothing beautiful from head to toe,
Merely aniccaṃ, dukkhaṃ, anattā.
Commit to wisdom
Know and see
In light with its reality.""

In the satipathanna sutta, the buddha said that the highway to enlightenment is the four satipathannas, that if anyone practiced in this way, they would achieve awakening. As far as I can understand, this is Vipassana.

&amp;#x200B;

""Let alone seven years, bhikkhus, whosoever practises these four satipatthanas in this manner for six years, five years, four years, three years, two years, or one year.

Let alone one year, bhikkhus, whosoever practises these four satipatthanas in this manner for seven months, one of two results is to be expected in him: Arahatship in this very existence, or if there yet be any trace of clinging, the state of an Anagami.

Let alone seven months, bhikkhus, whosoever practises these four satipatthanas in this manner for six months, five months, four months, three months, two months, one month, or half a month.""

""Bhikkhus, this is the one and the only way for the purification (of the minds) of beings, for overcoming sorrow and lamentation, for the cessation of physical and mental pain, for attainment of the Noble Paths, and for the realization of Nibbana. That only way is the four satipatthanas"".

""Let alone half a month, bhikkhus, whosoever practises these four satipatthanas in this manner for seven days, one of two results is to be expected in him: Arahatship in this very existence or if there yet be any trace of clinging, the state of an Anagami.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Jhana

&amp;#x200B;

But the Jhana's are ""right concentration."" I am reading the essence of the buddha's teaching by thich nhat hanh, and he says that 9th jhana is ""cessation,"" and that this is where the end of suffering it.

&amp;#x200B;

""I tell you, the ending of the mental fermentations depends on the first jhana... the second jhana... the third... the fourth... the dimension of the infinitude of space... the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness... the dimension of nothingness. I tell you, the ending of the mental fermentations depends on the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.

""'I tell you, the ending of the mental fermentations depends on the first jhana.' Thus it has been said. In reference to what was it said? There is the case where a monk, withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation. He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with form, feeling, perceptions, fabrications, and consciousness, as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a disintegration, a void, not-self. He turns his mind away from those phenomena, and having done so, inclines his mind to the property of deathlessness: 'This is peace, this is exquisite -- the resolution of all fabrications; the relinquishment of all acquisitions; the ending of craving; dispassion; cessation; Unbinding.'

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So which is it? 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems to me that Jhanas are a pure concentration technique. So which one is right concentration? Which one is the right track to stream entry?"

Buddhism,What will happen to the cycle of reincarnation after Earth?,"I was listening to a song by willow smith and one of the lines resonated with me: “he’s running out of time, trying to get from A to B to eternity”. As we continue to destroy our planet, we’re running out of time to reach enlightenment. When the Earth is completely destroyed, what will happen? Will the cycle of reincarnation be halted? Perhaps there will be a latency period as the universe waits for another planet capable of housing consciousness to be created? Or maybe beings on other planets across the universe are already built into our cycle of reincarnate. "
Buddhism,"New one interested to Buddhism here, where can I start?","I am personally agnostic towards the general Big 3 Monotheistic idea of God. So I'm not religious in that manner.

I'm not interested in the stuff about the cycle of rebirth, as I personally do not think that stuff is true. 

But disregarding that, where can I get started on learning Buddhist principles? I've heard and it seems from lurking/browsing here, that meditation is a big component of Buddhism. I'm just confused as to what is the path of things that I learn and practice. *I don't know what I don't know*, I'd just like a *good outline/roadmap of the teachings*.

Buddhism,A couple serious things that tested me and really helped me solidify my views.,"So for a while even as a lay person I've been practicing some things that for some reason people have suggested not to.

The first time I ever hit close to jhana was a total accident. I practice jhana but with the goal of enlightenment not to sound cool nor to benefit myself in this world as best I can phrase it.

That and other things brought me to buddhism, not the other way around. It and many other views I've had just fit perfectly. 

Others like mindfulness of the body from the suttas.  I'm not sure why it was advised I not do it. It's not hard to look at what the body is so to say but still perform the daily duties I'd begun before becoming serious.

Recently I nearly died. I was on life support for a week and on top of the initial cause even with it and all of the sedation went into respiratory failure as an indirect result of the initial cause. I knew I was about done even while in such a state but knew I had obligations to wrap up here first even without true attachment. I've always felt like I chose this life on purpose with the aim of helping some people in specific ways.

Once I snapped out of it, ""woke up"" and the sedation wore off I realized I didnt care. I thought nothing of it. I just accepted it for what it was. The only thing I felt bad about as I can best put it was my wife having to go through that. Luckily my children are too young to know except the fact I was gone. I mean I totally want to finish my obligation because I do not wish to cause them suffering and do love them but concerning ""myself"" I just thought nothing of it. Without family obligations I would have let go and accepted it.

On top of this I decided to water fast after recovering.  When my body seems it needs food I break it and eat but then continue. I'm well supplemented and honestly have weight to spare. It's not even for my body so to say. It's to make it more easy to pay attention to my thoughts, cravings and bodily function itself. Once I feel it has done it's job I'll return to normal eating except a more strict diet to where food is for sustenance instead of a habit or for enjoyment and likely keep it to a single meal at once before morning meditation.

Anyway though I've agreed with buddhism for a while things truly clicked in my mind so to say. It's not something I wish to elaborate on regarding some specifics but all positive for this path. I can be happy when I want but also faster than ever still my mind. I'll be recontinuuing my meditations tomorrow or the next day. Due to family obligations I need to have a strict schedule and the whole hospital thing had my sleep schedule way off so I've needed to cycle back.

I'm not sure why I felt like I should share. I believe it's mostly because I intended to share that what can seem like extremely negative things can truly benefit the path.

And I understand things may sound bad but only if taken out of context. I hope you are all doing well in the multitude of ways possible.

Some details I left out or vague on purpose for privacy. There are also some questions I will not answer IF they come up but that really just depends. You never know what gets said or asked online yet alone Reddit. 

Peace.

Just a quick edit, to elaborate on mindfulness of the body there is the day to day mindfulness of course but I specifically refer to as translated in English the portion of text from the suttas."
Buddhism,What are some Buddhist temples I should visit?,"I dream of traveling the world someday and visiting the most famous houses of worship I can find. Cathedrals, Synagogues, Mosques, and of course a variety of temples and shrines. I myself am pretty agnostic towards all religions but I can't help being fascinated by them. The gorgeous art, spiritual contemplation and philosophy of world religions are  usually displayed very well in some houses of worship. For example, the Sistine Chapel is filled with Michelangelo's paintings of the Biblical stories and as a result tells the onlooker of central Christian themes in stunning detail.

So I've been looking for Buddhist counterparts but it seems there are too many to pick from! So perhaps asking some actual Buddhists what their favorites are I can narrow them down a bit. Of course I wish I could visit them all but I not incredibly wealthy or have hundreds of years to spare. So considering artistic beauty and visual depictions of Buddhist themes, what are a few I should visit?"
Buddhism,How important is diet and exercise to Dharma?,I'm just curious to gather opinions. The Buddha says that we are to see ourselves as others in vice versa and that our compassion isn't complete if it doesn't include ourselves. So how is important to reaching Nirvana is it to eat a healthy diet and exercise our bodies? What kind of diets do you think would help practice Dharma?

Buddhism,Need help figuring out why I should still stay in Buddhism,"I was born a Buddhist, to a somewhat religious Buddhist family. We went to temple every Sunday and attended Buddhist classes. But recently something happened in the family that just made me doubt my faith altogether.

1- I cannot speak to God like the Christians do. I cannot ask for help, forgiveness or even just someone to listen to my prayers. There is no creator God in Buddhism and the Buddha has just dissappeared to Nibanna which is at god knows where, and is probably really unable to listen to my grievances anyway. 

2- I cannot reach out to the monks for advice. They are always scurrying off to some corner of the temple, and don't really build a relationship with any of their followers. They're revered and are there for lunch and special prayers. But there is a boundary between them and the followers that I find it hard to even want to talk to them in the first place.

3- I don't know why I pray. Apparently you're supposed to feel calmer afterwards. I feel the same before and after. It doesn't do anything for me. Good and bad things happen whether or not I pray. 

4- I hate meditation being forced upon me. Sure some people like them. But why do I have to do it? When I don't even like it. As if meditation is going to solve all of my problems. Maybe the whole world should just sit down, meditate and do nothing else then if that's the case.

Religion seems to have done nothing for me that my friends and family has, not even to listen to my grievances. Maybe I would be better off without a religion altogether? "
Buddhism,"Classic Buddhism VS. Theravada, Mahyana and Vajrayana and how does the west interpret buddhism compared to the east?","Hey all, so as far as I understand, there was some sort of classical buddhism before Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana, is that (classic buddhism) still alive or is classic buddhism one of these: Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana? 

And also, what are the differences between the western way to look at buddhism and the eastern way to look at buddhism? I can imagine that we in the west tend to look more at buddhism like some sort of a logical ""atheistical"" system, where we are not bound to one specific god, because the god is within.

Buddhism,Help finding a teacher?,"I've been studying Buddhism for a few years, and have pleasantly enjoyed my time doing so. However, I haven't had many opprotunities to practice with a group of people, and those I have had haven't felt quite right.

I have been to a Zen center, and while it was beautiful and I connect with the Zen teachings well, I found the people to be almost unwelcoming. Not much interraction besides ""sit there"".

I had an interraction with a Soka Gokkai group. They were nice enough but kept stressing the chanting to the Gohonzon over anything else.

I went to a Vietnamese Buddhist temple in Mississippi, but since there were few who spoke english, all of their literature and chanting was done in Vietnamese, and it seemed like the focus was on chanting rather than simple meditation, I realized quickly it would not work out. 

I have also been to a center in Spokane, WA (I'm not sure what the name was or the specific school they were a part of) for a dharma talk, but I didn't quite connect there.

I'm wondering if I am letting my impressions and standard of finding ""the sangha"" hinder me, and should try to stick it out somewhere local (I live in Spokane now).

Buddhism,Identifying a Buddha statue,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

Before I started my investigation into Buddhism, my partner bought me a small buddha statue that I'm now trying to identify. I've read a few articles that were pointed to in the FAQ however I'm battling to find reference to my exact buddha. 

&amp;#x200B;

The statue seems to be the meditating buddha, in a double lotus position however the one detail I can't seem to find info on is that he seems to be holding a ball in his lap. Based on my reading I though that this could be an alms bowl, but it's a perfectly spherical ball and not a bowl.

Buddhism,Life is like the time between a leaf falling from a branch and it hitting the ground,"I'm not a perfect devout Buddhist who believes in every tenant but I know this is where I should post this, because this is where it comes from (and from listening to Alan Watts).

A leaf detaches, flips, flies, and crashes into other leaves along its great descent. It lives, it gets stuck, it gets free again, it gets wet, but ultimately, all leaves hit the ground. Though once they're there, something magical happens. It may be over a season, it may be over a few, but eventually that leaf will become rich soil, the type its mother tree once sprang it from, and it will experience a new life of fertilizing the trees around it, and possibly even fertilizing the one it came from. From there, the leaf will live a whole new life, possibly another life as a free leaf again.

What if our souls inhabit every piece and part of our body? Once the life from our bodies is inanimate, and its physical form dispersed throughout the world or cosmos, if one is cremated, or buried in a wooden casket, we get to live another life again. Our soul enchanted remains turn to dirt and the dirt turns into energy for the plants. From there we can become anything, the offspring of an bird, bee, or bear once eaten.

What if our bodies get stuck? Buried in a cave or entombed in a pyramid forever? Well they're not going to be stuck *forever* on Earth because even Earth has a clock that's ticking down. The sun will one day eat the Earth and it'll will go through the stages of a star's life until finally blinking out along with the rest of the stars in the universe. If one believes in the theory of the '[big crunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Crunch)' the idea is that the universe will all once again come together through gravity to form a dense point in space building up until it explodes into another big bang, then all the lives that have ever been lived have the possibility of being lived again.

Your thoughts? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

"" Within [Tibetan Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhism) and other more esoteric forms of Buddhism, dreadlocks have occasionally been substituted for the more traditional shaved head. The most recognizable of these groups are known as the [Ngagpas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngagpa) of Tibet. For many practicing Buddhists, dreadlocks are a way to let go of material vanity and excessive attachments.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreadlocks#cite_note-26) Dreadlocks were required for many esoteric Buddhist rituals in medieval South Asia performed by Buddhist yogis (Buddhist counterparts to contemporary Hindu sadhus). For instance, 1.4.15 of the [Hevajratantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hevajra#Hevajra_Tantra) states that the practitioner ""should arrange his piled up hair"".[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreadlocks#cite_note-27) In contemporary Tibetan practice matted hair is replaced by crowns with matted hair attached to them.

For me to want to speak, means I want to be heard, means I am not content in the present. This feels selfish, I want my friends to experience what I was feeling!

Buddhism,Having Trouble Finding My Way Back,"I've been practicing Buddhism since April of this year, and I've noticed a substantial change in my life. I've experienced things in a new way: in the now, with patience, compassion and little to no judgement. I've understood the 3 Dharma seals both intellectually *and* intuitively. But in September, I suffered a back injury and my practice faltered. I was in a lot of pain, which kept me anxious and unmotivated to meditate, so things regressed to their former state. 

Since then, I've healed somewhat, and have been able to focused on my practice again, but things aren't the same. I feel like I can't get back to where I was. I try to internalize the teachings as before, and I *know* them, intellectually, but I can't gain the intuitive insights. It feels mechanical. I know part of my problem is probably that I am *trying* (having expectations of experience rather than letting things happen), but it's just getting to me. Any advice or words from the who have been in similar situations would be greatly appreciated."
Buddhism,Overcoming anger to cultivate a healthy and loving relationship with my girlfriend,"For the past few months, my relationship with my girlfriend has been one filled with intense jealousy and insecurity. We had been fighting and had even considered breaking up at one point. As you can expect, these feelings of jealousy and insecurity eventually turned into anger.

&amp;#x200B;

I would try to stop these jealous and angry thoughts by trying to distract myself. I tried to ignore them. I tried to replace them with positive thoughts to remind me that I am dating someone I truly love. It didn't work. I was still angry, but even though I knew I was angry I didn't want to admit it. My dad has a serious anger issue and I did not want to believe that I had one too.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week my girlfriend said to me, ""I think you're an angry person. I think you have a serious anger issue and if you aren't able to get your anger under control I don't think I can date you long-term."" This broke my heart. I knew my anger was destroying me, but I thought I was managing it well... this was evidence that I was not. It wasn't until she said this that I was able to admit to her I had an anger issue. Before, I was so blind to this anger issue I had that I had been putting all the blame on her for how I was feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

On the drive back to my house I had some time to think. I had known my anger had been an issue for some time, but now that I had admitted it I felt like I was able to deal with it. I had to deal with it... Especially if it was affecting someone I loved. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I got home I sent her the following message:

""Thanks for talking tonight. I had some time to think about what you said and I’m very ashamed and sorry for how I’ve been treating you. You were right. I have been very hard on you. It’s easy for me to tell you what you should work on, but self-reflection &amp; self-awareness is sometimes uncomfortable &amp; painful. I’m going to work on my anger, and my self-hatred &amp; I’m going to try to work on being more open &amp; honest. Sorry for putting you through so much crap you shouldn’t have to deal with. I love you &amp; I need to get better at showing it.""

&amp;#x200B;

She thanked me for finally admitting that I had an issue with anger and promising to do something about it. I got started immediately. I remembered that over 2 years ago I had bought a book called ""Anger"" by Thich Nhat Hanh and started reading it that night. This book has been a huge help to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it has only been one week, but I feel much different. I am learning to embrace the thoughts that pop into my head that used to cause me jealousy and anger. Instead of trying to repress them I can have those thoughts and ask myself ""Why are you thinking about this? What are you trying to solve? Why are you trying to cause pain to yourself and those you love?"" It didn't take long for this line of questioning to ultimately lead me to discover that I have intense self-hatred. I am causing myself pain because that is what I feel I deserve. I have made mistakes in the past and by having these thoughts I was forcing myself to pay for them almost every day, even though others have been able to forgive me I was unable to forgive myself.

&amp;#x200B;

So that night I wrote in my journal ""Work on your relationship with yourself. Have a good relationship with yourself so you can have a good relationship to the world. Let go of bad energy and the people and events still living inside of you.""

&amp;#x200B;

I am doing my best to live up to the words I wrote in my journal, and things in my relationship with my girlfriend and myself have improved. I am learning to treat myself more like a friend than an enemy, so that I can be more loving in my external relationships. Of course, things aren't perfect, but I am taking things day by day and seeking to take care of myself, watch my tongue and provide a loving and accepting space for my loved ones.

  
However, there are still some things I am struggling with. For example, I never can measure up to my own standards and expectations. How do I like myself more? This is something I am really wrestling with. I suspect that my suffering comes from non-accepting. I want to be something more than I am. I've held myself to an unattainable standard and must learn to go easy on myself.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone else out there is struggling with anger, I highly recommend that book. And if anyone has any stories or advice they would like to share - I am listening."
Buddhism,Conditions in a monastery and in the real life,"Hello, I have watched many videos about meditation or just basically about buddhism. I know that when a Lama teaches lay people meditation, he always says that they should be gentle to their bodies and minds and just enjoy the meditation. But when I read about experiences in monasteries, people often says that there are very hard conditions and it's very hard to stay there for a long time.

What do you think? Should be one gentle to oneself or just take it as a kind of duty (meditating)?

EDIT: Do you know why on some courses are hard conditions as in a monastery?

I just don't know why are there hard conditions, because I think that could be harmful especially for our body. Many new monks and people on some courses complain about the knees and back pain and that's absolutely unhealthy. So I don't see any logic there. On the one hand there is the very gentle approach and on the other hand you have very hard mind and body conditions. "

right now i am dealing with health problems that are creeping up because i hadn’t properly taken care of some things when i was younger. one of my cats is living out her end days with kidney failure. i am caretaking, medicating, and witnessing her in discomfort in her old age. my parents are also getting old and have their own health problems. 

in the past i distanced myself from death. i was not good at visiting sick and dying family members. i haven’t attended all of the funerals my family would’ve liked me too. my parents always took care of the pets when they passed away or had to be euthanized. i was present for burials and one euthanization but because they were the responsible ones, there was a distance there that i would feel safe in. now i am my pets’ primary caretaker so i am dealing with it all up close

i remember listening to noah rashetta’s secular buddhism podcast on death, and just feeling...crazy inside my body. crazy body feelings. 

i want to face it all, see the truth, and relax. i just bought the book, but was wondering if my friends here thought that would be a good thing to read now, or whether there are other texts more catered toward this kind of thing.

Buddhism,There is no nirvana,"Hi everyone! A little background about myself:

Been learning the dhamma for about 3 years. I'm an atheist and a skeptic, and so I approach all of Buddhism under the stereotypical ""American/humanist/skeptic"" lens, as in, I love meditation, the benefits, the humanistic compassion, etc. I just can't believe in things that have no evidence or confirmation, such as reincarnation. That doesn't mean Buddhism is still not great.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm here because I have a simple question:

&amp;#x200B;

The Buddha said that everything, all of existence, is subject to change. I get that, it seems to be absolutely accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

But then there's ONE STATE, nirvana, where suffering ceases.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think that's possible. See, even if nirvana was true ... why couldn't it eventually, even after eons and eons, change into delusion and ignorance again, starting the whole chain of suffering again?

&amp;#x200B;

So of course, I see a benefit to stopping suffering in the NOW by not ""building"" more formations of mental states that cause suffering. However, I don't see how, in an ultimate, absolute sense, you can guarantee no FUTURE suffering after nirvana. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear anyone's thoughts on this. Thanks!"
Buddhism,What set samsara in motion?,"I’m definitely not well versed in Buddhist literature, and I hope that this question and the following doesn’t come across as too oversimplified. 
If we are experiencing a cycle of birth, death and rebirth, and the goal is to escape/transcend this state by achieving an ultimate state of enlightenment/awareness/reality, why did the cycle of birth, death, rebirth begin in the first place?

Buddhism,How to deal with rude children,"These are my own children and one of them is going through a 'sassy' phase. I have volunteered at the school and it is running rampant in his class.

When I try to talk to my child directly about gratitude (e.g., lets think of things we are grateful for) he will say 'nothing' or list something that has an insult in it. He has struggled with depression in the past so it is not completely oppositional, some of it is his genuine feelings."
Buddhism,A Message To People The World Over [Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche's introduction to Buddhism for beginners],"Foremost I would like to tell you that an enlightened essence is present in everyone. It is present in every state, both samsara and nirvana, and in al sentient beings: there is no exception. Experience your buddha nature, make it your constant practice, and you will reach enlightenment. In my lifetime I have known many, many people who attained such an enlightened state, both male and female. Awakening to enlightenment is not an ancient fable. It is not mythology. It actually does happen.Bring the oral instructions into your own practical experience and enlightenment is indeed possible; it is not just a fairy tale.

To realize our buddha nature, we need the support of three principles. First is the precious Buddha, the primal teacher who showed the enlightened essence to others. Next is the precious dharma, the teachings on how to train in experiencing the enlightened essence. Lastly, there is the precious sangha, the people who uphold and spread the teachings. Additionally, there are three roots: there is the guru, the root of blessings; the yidam, the root of accomplishment; and the dakini, the root of activities. They possess all-knowing wakefulness, all-embracing compassion, the activity of deeds for the benefit of beings, and the capacity to protect and save others.

Sometimes we may have doubts and hesitation when relating to the Buddha's teachings, but do not leave it with that. It is very important to validate what is trustworthy and what is not. My teachers mentioned four kinds of validation. First are the words of a perfectly enlightened being, such as the Buddha, whose statements are never unwise. Then there are the teachings by the great masters of the lineage, passed from one to the other
until today. Third are the instructions we receive from our own personal teacher. Finally, to decide with certainty, we need the validation of our own intelligence. Do not leave anything to blind faith or convential belief. Examine for yourself what is really the truth.

What is the reason for the misery and pain every living being undergoes? What is the cause of samsara's delusion? It is nothing other than lacking the experience of our enlightened essence. We ignore what is primordially present; we neglect what is continually present within us: our buddha nature. Instead, immersed in confused emotions, we chase illusory aims that endlessly result in more deluded experience. That's called samsara. We have already done that for countless lifetimes, life after life, death following rebirth. Unless you now take this opportunity, while you are stil a human being, to realize what is fully possible, you will continue in the future in the same deluded way.

Please understand that the buddha nature is present within everyone. Nobody lacks this potential, not even a single person in this world. Unless you learn how to bring it into your personal experience, train in that and realize it, you remain deluded. Delusion never disappears by itself. Spinning around on the rim of samsara's vicious wheel, on the twelve links of dependent origination, you will continue life after life. We all die are reborn, and die again, countless times.

But, in this present life, you can learn to experience your enlightened essence, and if you do that, you can, before passing away, attain the perfectly and fully awakened state of a buddha. The method to transform this human body into rainbow light at the moment of death is only through recognizing and realizing our buddha nature; there is no other possible way. The instruction for how to do that is still available. Place your trust in the three jewels: the precious Buddha, dharma and sangha Receive this teaching from someone who holds an unbroken lineage: this lineage is still intact. Otherwise, everyone dies; there is no exception. In the past, everyone who lived in this world died. Right now everyone alive will die. Everyone born in the future will also die. Everything in the world changes; nothing remains the same, nothing is permanent, nothing lasts. If you want to be successful, if you really want to take care of yourself - recognize your enlightened essence.

Buddhism,The Layman Bodhisattva,"From the [Vimalakirti Nirdesa Sutra](https://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln260/Vimalakirti.htm):

His wealth was inexhaustible for the purpose of sustaining the poor and the helpless. He observed a pure morality in order to protect the immoral. He maintained tolerance and self-control in order to reconcile beings who were angry, cruel, violent, and brutal. He blazed with energy in order to inspire people who were lazy. He maintained concentration, mindfulness, and meditation in order to sustain the mentally troubled. He attained decisive wisdom in order to sustain the foolish.

He wore the white clothes of the layman, yet lived impeccably like a religious devotee. He lived at home, but remained aloof from the realm of desire, the realm of pure matter, and the immaterial realm. He had a son, a wife, and female attendants, yet always maintained continence. He appeared to be surrounded by servants, yet lived in solitude. He appeared to be adorned with ornaments, yet always was endowed with the auspicious signs and marks. He seemed to eat and drink, yet always took nourishment from the taste of meditation. He made his appearance at the fields of sports and in the casinos, but his aim was always to mature those people who were attached to games and gambling. He visited the fashionable heterodox teachers, yet always kept unswerving loyalty to the Buddha. He understood the mundane and transcendental sciences and esoteric practices, yet always took pleasure in the delights of the Dharma. He mixed in all crowds, yet was respected as foremost of all.

In order to be in harmony with people, he associated with elders, with those of middle age, and with the young, yet always spoke in harmony with the Dharma. He engaged in all sorts of businesses, yet had no interest in profit or possessions. To train living beings, he would appear at crossroads and on street corners, and to protect them he participated in government. To turn people away from the Hinayana and to engage them in the Mahayana, he appeared among listeners and teachers of the Dharma. To develop children, he visited all the schools. To demonstrate the evils of desire, he even entered the brothels. To establish drunkards in correct mindfulness, he entered all the cabarets.

He was honored as the businessman among businessmen because he demonstrated the priority of the Dharma. He was honored as the landlord among landlords because he renounced the aggressiveness of ownership. He was honored as the warrior among warriors because he cultivated endurance, determination, and fortitude. He was honored as the aristocrat among aristocrats because he suppressed pride, vanity, and arrogance. He was honored as the official among officials because he regulated the functions of government according to the Dharma. He was honored as the prince of princes because he reversed their attachment to royal pleasures and sovereign power. He was honored as a eunuch in the royal harem because he taught the young ladies according to the Dharma.

He was compatible with ordinary people because he appreciated the excellence of ordinary merits. He was honored as the Indra among Indras because he showed them the temporality of their lordship. He was honored as the Brahma among Brahmas because he showed them the special excellence of gnosis. He was honored as the Lokapala among Lokapalas because he fostered the development of all living beings.

Thus lived the Licchavi Vimalakirti in the great city of Vaisali, endowed with an infinite knowledge of skill in liberative techniques."

Buddhism,I think I may have found my sangha!,"Yesterday I went to a Tibetan center, and holy crap I think I finally have found the community I've always wanted!
It was a three-hour-long Troma Nakmo practice with tsok. I have always seen videos of chanting and chöd practice, but I never thought I would actually be IN a practice like that! It was surreal to hear the chöd drums, the bells, and an actual rinpoche chanting along with all of us! 
I met absolutely wonderful people there. I met a woman there and we talked and talked, and I told her my dream of being a translator. Now I want to pursue that dream even more now! I even think they may be holding Tibetan classes sometime in the future.
I've been to the center two times before, but this third time was different. The people, the atmosphere, the sounds, and the smells. All were just extra amazing! 
When I left and got in the car, I told my dad (Who isn't a Buddhist, but incredibly supportive of me) something along the lines of ""I think I have found my sangha.""
2017 and 2018 were the absolute hardest years for me, but I have a feeling with a sangha, regular dharma practice, and extra therapy I will make this next year (or at least next year and the year after that) THE year of triumph over some of my problems. I felt happy the whole rest of the day afterward, which hasn't happened in months. I caught myself becoming sad today, but I'm working on it.
If anyone feels hopeless and lonely, please know it will get better. After all, all conditioned phenomena are impermanent, including situations.

Thank you all for being such a wonderful online sangha in the meantime, and thank you to all the knowledgeable users that have helped guide me. Thank you all so so so much for being so wonderful."

The only problem is that the internet is quite confusing, so I was hoping for a more interactive explanation. I have been meditating for about two weeks, and have found great success, and some failures. I am an incredibly scientific person, and it really helps me to know the point of something.

Buddhism,"View as vast as the sky, conduct as fine as barley.","&gt; Guru Rinpoche also said, ""Though the view should be as vast as the sky, keep your conduct as fine as barley flour."" Don't confuse one with the other. When training in the view, you can be as unbiased, as impartial, as vast, immense, and unlimited as the sky. Your behavior, on the other hand, should be as careful as possible in discriminating what is beneficial or harmful, what is good or evil. One can combine the view and conduct, but don't mix them or lose one in the other. That is very important.

&gt; 'View like the sky' means that nothing is held onto in any way whatsoever. You are not stuck anywhere at all. In other words, there is no discrimination as to what to accept and what to reject; no line is drawn separating one thing from the other. 'Conduct as fine as barley flour' means that there is good and evil, and one needs to differentiate between the two. Give up negative deeds; practice the Dharma. In your behavior, in your conduct, it is necessary to accept and reject.

Buddhism,"Can anyone tell me a bit more about ""virtuous worldling""?","How is a virtuous worldling different than an uninstructed worldling? Is a virtuous worldling different than a lay follower? Is a virtuous worldling a bikkhu or bhikkhuni who has not yet attained stream entry?

Buddhism,"The nature of a desire. Questions, comments, and disagreements welcome","It seems to me, and correct me if this isn't right, that the cyclical system of depending on desires in order to feel at peace is truly just a system of repressing any attempts to feel at peace until the desire is procured.


1. A desire arises. This desire is almost always based on some kind of preference that's not currently being fulfilled in the present moment.  

2a. To follow the desire from here is a subtle way of rejecting the present as it is. This rejection of the present moment causes an emotional tension (often anxiety), which the mind believes the desire's acquirement will relieve. The sensation of longing and/or craving begins.

2b. Instead of following the desire, one may return to their awareness instead. Becoming focused on the present moment, it's easy to see the desire has no effect on continuing existence. The universe doesn't really care if we get what we want or not. It just keeps being the present either way. By accepting the present moment as it is, allowing ourselves to become comfortable within it, the desire no longer enslaves us to act. The sensation of longing dissipates

3a. If the desire is followed, the desire may be acquired. This will temporarily allow a fleeting feeling of peace. The peace will only exist until the next desire arises, which won't take long at all. The habit of procuring desires to find fulfillment continues (and is fortified by the finding of fleeting peace), and always fails to provide a lasting peace. Contentment is impossible for every other moment aside from the brief acquiring of a desire. Sometimes, even getting the desire does nothing for contentment. It's like getting flowers the day someone you love died. It's a nice gesture but does nil. Longing continues.

3b. If the desire is let go of, the feeling of anxious longing dissipates along with it. Attempts to control the present moment with desires cease. The unskillful habit of desire-and-suffering is replaced with the skillful habit of acceptance-and-peace. One realizes whether they get the desire or not, they'll be fine either way. Inner peace no longer depends on outside factors, and contentment is possible even alongside negative emotions.  Longing ceases.


All of this is to say that the two cycles of desire-and-suffering and acceptance-and-peace vary only in 1 way: When exactly the individual decides to let themselves feel at peace. 

When chasing desires, one doesn't even try to find peace in the present moment. One swears peace can only be found through the attainment of the desire and nothing else (without bothering to check if that's true or not). 

When accepting the present as the only possible option, one doesn't even try to find peace in desires. One knows it will feel like the present either way.

One last note about the nature of desires and peace:

Desire always stems from the belief that the present moment isn't good enough as it is, and that something else, when added to it, would make it better.

Peace always stems from the enjoyment of the present moment as it is. 

In truth, the present moment is all there is. We can either reject it and try to fix it endlessly (as all attempts to change out turn out to be futile in providing sustained peace) or continuously accept it and allow ourselves to continuously enjoy it by doing so.


If you really want to go way out there to the advanced course, once one realizes the present is all there is, there proves to be no ""self"" separated from the present in order to judge it, hold preferences over it, desire it to be different, accept it peacefully, or anything else. The ""present"" and the ""self"" both are seen to be imagined conceptualizations with imagined boundaries. As imagined conceptualizations are unreal, the boundaries are unreal as well and all things, in reality, appear the same as usual but are experienced as an undivided oneness (without even an ""I"" to experience it).

Buddhism,Requirements to be called 'Lama',I was thinking about Tibetan titles and couldn't find any resource that explained if there is a process to being called a Lama. Would anyone know if there is such a process in any of the particular schools? Or is it more of a general title one just comes to be called after teaching for however long? There's a process to earning the title Geshe/Geshema or Khenpo/Khenmo in the Gelug and Kagyu schools respectively and was curious if one receives the title Lama in a similar fashion.

Buddhism,"I stayed at two Buddhist monasteries in Sri Lanka for 6 months. This is what I learned. (Jhana, Buddha, concentration/absorption, Vipassana)","I learned A LOT.

&amp;#x200B;

Although two of the most important things for ME that I learned is that there seems to be a an old misunderstanding actually dating back thousands of years regarding what The Buddha said about meditation: On entering the so-called ""Jhanas"".

&amp;#x200B;

This is what *I* came to learn. Others might have heard otherwise etc.

&amp;#x200B;

It's that what most people refer to as ""Jhana""-meditation (from the Visuddhimagga) - and that The Buddha supposedly taught this method, is a totally different meditation than what The Buddha ACTUALLY talked about. It is said in the scriptures that Buddha himself stated that the old yogic/Hindu meditation with 8 different levels of concentration is never going to get you enlightened. He himself supposedly (I'm not doubting this) reached the 8th level after three months of practice and that his teachers subsequently asked him to teach them. This meditation is what many refer to as ""Jhana meditation"", but is actually just a concentration or absorption meditation and little else. The confusing thing is that it says in the Visuddhimagga that this is how The Buddha told his disciples to meditate. And this method is now being taught throughout Asian countries to be the ""how to guide"" on how to do meditation. It becomes even more confusing because The Buddha used this term long before Visuddhimagga was written, but he did not describe what is taught in the Visuddhimagga. Although the name is the same! What THE BUDDHA taught Jhana meditation to be could be described as “Samatha Vipassana”.

&amp;#x200B;

An author I don't remember the name of has researched this extensively and these excerpts are from her book. I hope it's okay to paste it here.

&amp;#x200B;

On how The Buddha described how to get into the first Jhana (What I now call “Buddha Jhana”):

&amp;#x200B;

""This model describes a series of practices that enable the practitioner to possess the qualities that comprise the Buddhist path. These practices are (1) the training in morality (slla-khandha); (2) the practice of guarding and restraining the impressions brought about by sense experience (indriya-samvara); and (3) the practice of full awareness (sampajiina).

&amp;#x200B;

At this point of the spiritual path, one can advance to the last stage, namely, resorting to a secluded place, where the instruction is very clear: to 'sit down, folding the legs crosswise, setting the body erect and establishing mindfulness in front'.

&amp;#x200B;

When this is achieved, the practitioner abandons the five hindrances and enters into the first jhana.""

&amp;#x200B;

""...one has to relinquish, or let go of, any unwholesomeness for entering the first jhana.""

&amp;#x200B;

""...one attains the first jhana rather, by releasing and letting go of the foothold of unwholesome mind. This seems to be achieved by the practice of morality, sense restraint and observation of phenomena.""

&amp;#x200B;

The five hindrances are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

Sensual desire (kamacchanda)

Ill-will (byapada)

Sloth and torpor (thina-middha)

Restlessness and remorse (uddhacca-kukkucca)

Sceptical doubt (vicikiccha)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, someone might correct me on this. But what I understand this ""Samatha Vipassana"" to be is that it basically means concentration PLUS observation of bodily phenomena. So the concentration part is what the Visuddhimagga teaches (the 8 levels of concentration-Jhana), but it doesn't teach the observation of bodily phenomena part (Vipassana).

The thing is, these are two sides of the same coin. To be able to observe bodily phenomena you need to be able to concentrate on the same thing for a long time. Meanwhile, to merely concentrate on one thing is empty (the Visuddhimagga Jhana). It's just concentration. It is allegedly “devoid of wisdom”. Wisdom apparently comes from combining the two: To maintain concentration on bodily phenomena.

&amp;#x200B;

Here I want to say that I learned that people are very different in what suit their personality the best to start with -either concentration or vipassana. For myself it is the Vipassana part, but others might be more inclined towards the concentration part. One should practise the method that works best for him/her. As long as you know that neither of the methods alone can get you all the way. You need to work on both.

&amp;#x200B;

I will now write a little bit about what I believe this “Samatha Vipassana” is, how I do it and about my experience with it.

&amp;#x200B;

In my own words it is to concentrate your mind on exactly what is happening in the body right now in this moment. Try to feel inside and focus on what you are feeling right now. But not in words or thoughts. Just let yourself feel, exactly how it is. Feel it...

&amp;#x200B;

For me personally I quickly start to feel it physically. My restlessness and slight anxiety is manifested different places in my body. So I just look at that part. It might sound dumb but that's all I do. I just look at it and feel it in the moment. For instance, right now it is on the inside of my lower lip. Then I focus my mind to that part of my body. Just let my mind rest on that place. Soon the feeling of that place will change. Maybe it dims, maybe it strengthens. But just stay with it. Continue to observe it and look at it. This can be very hard! Both because the mind and your focus easily wavers over to something else, but maybe most of all because of the pain you feel. The emotional pain of watching something completely brutally honestly REAL happening inside of yourself. I think it even has been stated that this is the only thing that IS real. All of the external world is actually just a mirage and kind of an illusion. The only thing that is real are your so-called “Vedanas” - the feelings, bodily sensations, moods and thought complexes that you experience at any given moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the meditation. After a while, what you are looking at inside of yourself will naturally subside for the time being and a short ""break"" will perhaps follow where there isn't any longer any discomfort in that exact place. What you do then is to just relax and let your focus wander naturally around until it ""sees"" or ""feels"" another place in the body that is under some sort of stress or emotional pain/discomfort and start to the the same in this location of the body. I suppose the same holds if you are suddenly feeling good feelings, then you continue to feel it. Do not let your focus change to something else. Concentrate on the new part of the body, and if your mind wanders, just calmly go back to where you were when you remember what you were doing.

&amp;#x200B;

What happened to me was magical. Truly magical and to this day a bit of a mystery. After quite a while of doing this I could feel the different parts of my body where I had felt tenseness and emotional stress quietly subsided - by themselves! No need to go to a therapy session or other similar options with counseling. I found that THE FEELINGS ETC. WILL NATURALLY SUBSIDE IF YOU JUST WATCH IT OR CONCENTRATE ON IT FOR A LONG ENOUGH TIME!

&amp;#x200B;

This was unbelievable to me at first. I could almost not believe it. Then later, me and a western monk went to an island monastery. And here I had my first experience of TOTAL PEACE and TOTAL SILENCE. I practiced what I described above and then went on to feel a tenseness in my neck, where I ended up sitting in an awkward position with my neck where I stretched a muscle on the side of my neck for over ten minutes! I just continued watching/feeling/observing it. The neck was where my focus naturally went after having focused on other emotional feelings throughout my body before that. Then the tenseness in my neck muscles gradually let go and I ended up in my initial position with my head straight. Then. Suddenly, all by itself there was SILENCE. And I mean pure, no thoughts or feelings, SILENCE.

&amp;#x200B;

It was very subtle and feeble. Like there was a sense to it that this could very easily be disturbed. I maintained this for maybe five minutes and it might have been the strongest experience I've ever had with meditation. Just pure silence. True ""nothingness"". Devoid of any internal chatter or any feelings whatsoever.

&amp;#x200B;

I will never forget that experience and I am so fortunate that I now know the how-to on what I must do to experience it. It takes time, effort and discipline though.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I kind of just want to make this a one-time big post, so I will keep writing what I want to talk about next. Which is the concentration meditation I talked about in the beginning that The Buddha said will never by itself lead you to enlightenment:

&amp;#x200B;

The Visuddhimagga Jhana's

&amp;#x200B;

My interpretation of this whole ordeal is that historically, long before Buddha's time, there has been practiced these concentration meditations. The thing is, you can actually concentrate on ANYTHING, and you will after a while, if you are able to maintain it, feel such a strong feeling of bliss that it’s really quite unimaginable.

I imagine that people have been doing this meditation for hundreds, if not thousands of years. And that they over time came to find out certain objects to concentrate on that you could reach ""higher"" levels of concentration with.

The main Visuddhimagga way of practicing Jhana/concentration meditation is to focus on the breathing at a particular point (the upper lip area). But there are others later in the text. Some of them are called the ""Ten Kasinas"". These are ten objects that you can practice to meditate or focus your concentration on and reach these higher levels of concentrations with. Some lets you reach up to ""fourth level Jhana"", whilst others let you reach all the way up to the eight level. I don't remember which lets you go the furthest, but this has little value knowing unless you are really going to go into it.

&amp;#x200B;

The ten kasinas are:

Earth

Water

Air

Fire

Blue, green

Yellow

Red

White

Enclosed space, hole, aperture

Bright light

&amp;#x200B;

Something very enlightening I learned was that the first four of these: The earth, water, air and fire “elements” aren’t all “wishy-washy” concepts, but are actually referring to some very real properties:

&amp;#x200B;

**Earth** is meant to describe the property of the universe that we in other words call “mass”, or “physicality”. Try to imagine something very hard. For instance iron, or bedrock. Imagine going into this matter and “see” and “feel” how hard and compressed it is. Feel it’s essence: solidness. Hardness. Soak up that feeling, and STAY IN IT and continue “imagining it”.

That’s how one should meditate on the 1st Kasina (Earth element).

&amp;#x200B;

**Water** is another word for the property of the universe we also call “the binding force”. In a sense gravity. The force that pulls things together. It is a force you can find and feel, one that exists and that you can focus on. Focus on that property of the universe and you will be meditating on the 2nd Kasina (Water element).

&amp;#x200B;

**Air** points to the fluidity of space-time or the universe. Motion. The principle that things move. Wind, liquid water streaming down a river, people moving. Grass growing, planets flying through space. Movement. Concentrate on this eternal principle and immerse yourself in it’s tangibility. That’s how you meditate on the 3rd Kasina (Air)

&amp;#x200B;

**Fire** describes temperature. Hot and cold. The scale of temperature. That things can be warm or cold. Your car engine, ice in your freezer, the sun, water in the ocean. All these have very different temperatures. To meditate on the fourth kasina you should absorb yourself into the spectrum of temperature. The essence of the feeling of “temperature-ness” or of what one specific temperature feels like.

&amp;#x200B;

The rest are fairly self-explanatory. Just focus on the color or on the enclosed space or on the white bright light and stay with it. Just as with the elements.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to these 10 however, there are also two more concentration objects: Space, and consciousness.

&amp;#x200B;

**Space** refers to just that: Space. Inside your body there is an incredible amount of space. The body is a macrocosm of cells and elements. It inhabits a lot of space. It takes space. Focus on that first. Then move on to feel the space around you, in your room or on your immediate surroundings. Then move further with your mind. Imagine the space of your town or district. In all directions from you. Up, down, left, right. Back and forward. Really feel all of that space. And expand the feeling that you have of space. The property of space. Move further and further. All the way to galaxies and galaxy-clusters. Expand how much of the space around you that you are feeling. Space is possibly endless, so this is a good way to reach full concentration. I personally like it very much, as you can imagine there being space soo far in every direction. You can feel the lengths of how far space expands. Feel it and let yourself get absorbed into it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Consciousness** is also just what it says. If you concentrate on feeling it, there is sort of a similar feeling to a “presence”. One that is always there. We say that we have it, because it is a part of what our bodies can sense and use and manipulate. If we focus strongly enough. You can feel it seething in the whole universe. The universe is literally infused with this stuff. It is something very concrete that you can feel and hold on to. A property of the universe. Absorb yourself into it.

&amp;#x200B;

If you practice any of these intensely, over a long period of time - and regularly - you will eventually start to have experiences. Experiences that in fact seems to be universal to all human (and maybe also sentient) beings. When you guide your focus onto one thing only or onto only one object, and you are able to maintain that focus for a long time things will start happening. Phenomena that you didn’t know existed. You will start to see lights on the inside of your eyelids. Don’t focus on those though. And eventually you will feel immense bliss. The monk that I learned this from said that you should be aware that this is also just momentary in the long run. That this bliss will also fade when you die and get reborn somewhere else. That it will change little or nothing on your “soul’s” path to true liberation or to your karma. He said that some monks become what he termed “Jhana junkies”. Monks that sit for hours on end (8-10 hours or even much longer) and “bliss out” with this meditation. They get lost in the bliss it creates. And the bliss is very strong, so I don’t doubt that you can actually get addicted to it.

&amp;#x200B;

This was it for a summary of things that I learned while staying at two different Buddhist monasteries in Sri Lanka for a total of six months. May some of these experiences act as a guide for someone out there.

&amp;#x200B;

With metta.

Buddhism,"We have a lifetime to prepare for death, and we rarely get around to it.","A bright light is blaring in our face, but we look away. We can’t see it and sometimes forget it’s there. We suspect a missing grace through stories of apples and gardens. An infinite power is animating us, and we are just afraid. Our true parent is not human. We existed before the cells started mingling in the oceans. 

The world is already a perfect balance. The deepest fear of death just reflects the deepest sense of coming home. We have to play out this human drama, and hopefully we can align our will with our deepest sense of intuitive wisdom and goodwill. Our stories of heavens and grace are just a suspected notion that there is a peace here, a liberating deathless peace."
Buddhism,Where and how should I start practising?,"Dear all,
I've been raised an atheist with a scientific background and I feel completely skeptical whenever it comes to reincarnation, afterlife or supernatural phenomena... However I started reading about Buddhism two years ago: Majjhima Nikaya, Walpola Rahula, In the Buddha's words and one book by the Dalai-Lama. They really convinced me that there's definitely something to the Four Noble Truths, and I also regard compassion as the highest virtue, but I still can't believe in afterlife and rebirth, and I still don't understand karma... 

* Is it an obstacle to start practising? Should I read more before attempting to practice? 

* Also, I feel reading is really good, but they all emphasize the importance of practice, so where should I start? I've practised a bit of mindfulness meditation (just watching my breath really), but what should I look for? Some books only talk of breath, but others say you should reflect on something? How many sessions a week/day, how long? My point is, I've always done everything ""by the book"", with a scientific method telling you step by step what to do, like a recipe, and I feel a bit lost without it (I guess that's one of the attachment I'll have to work on...). 

* How do you manage to meditate when you have a working and family life?? 40 min to take on your own everyday is long, any advice to keep the motivation?

* Is there something else than mediating to practice?

* It is very impractical for me to get a teacher where I live (not a lot, expensive) and I don't even know which school of Buddhism I should turn to. Do you even need to pick up one school to start? Can I start without a teacher?

* My family and friends won't help, they consider Buddhism as a cult because of reincarnation and religious ceremonies... Don't really know how to explain to them, any good texts for atheist that could work?

Sorry that's a lot of questions but I hope some of them can be answered.

Thank you all for you're help and best of luck with your practice"
Buddhism,Celibacy,"Hello, I am deciding to go 1 year without sexual relations and mastrubation. No orgasms basically, with the intention of eliminate my attachment to the female body and energy. I see how this attachment have basically run all my life, all my goals, all my work, all my achievements, all my disasters, all my suffering, all my lust, etc etc..all negative emotions, thoughts and actions, as well as positive emotions , thoughts and actions, has been driven by the desire of the attention and  attraction to the female body and energy. 

Is it anyone here who has experience with celibate, who live in a modern society? Can anyone help me? 

I choose to be mindful, but my first reaction when I see a woman I find attractive is “ I want her” afterwards I correct myself, it’s only lust or a desire for companionship, and I focus on the breath. I mediate 2 hours a day, but still my attachment is still extremely strong. 

I truly appreciate all input, thank you.

With love

Buddhism,What's the definition of bad/evil in Buddhism?,And please explain in simple words.
Buddhism,Why pursue that which is impermanent?,"When contemplating impermance, it strikes me that it seems that my worldly pursuits are futile. It seems like everything I end up occupying myself with in my life is based in delusion of self and will ultimately lead me to suffering because of the impermanent nature of all things. I find myself falling into the pattern of thinking that all of this is a waste of time and when presented with Buddhist dharma, it seems like I should abandon the outside world and move to a monastery. Why waste my time on these other pursuits? If nothing will bring me lasting happiness, why pursue anything that is not a rigorous and disciplined approach to the dharma?

I understand that the dharma is not this black and white and that there is value in being a productive member of society, of interacting with other people, and that there is lots to be learned from life outside of a monastic approach, but I guess I am still not completely convinced that I shouldn't become a monk. Does anyone have any helpful passages where the Buddha spoke on this?

Buddhism,Question about an excerpt from the Samyutta Nikaya,"So I got the book the *Teachings of the Buddha* (edited by Jack Kornfield) and I saw this excerpt from the *Samyutta Nikaya* (translated by David Maurice):

 &gt;""JUST so, Ananda, in one who contemplates the enjoyment of all things that make for clinging, craving arises; through craving, clinging is conditioned; through clinging, the process of becoming is conditioned; through the process of becoming, rebirth is conditioned; through rebirth are conditioned old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair. Thus arises the whole mass of suffering again in the future.""

So what is meant by ""the process of becoming""? Is that developing a ""self"" or ""ego""? "

Buddhism,Manjushri,
Buddhism,What is self?,"I’ve recently started exploring Buddhism, and one topic I’ve been thinking about and am somewhat confused on as I’ve heard/read different things is the idea of self and what that really is.


I read Mindfulness; A Practical Guide to Awakening by Joseph Goldstein and if I remember correctly he stated multiple times that there is no “self”, no observer that is actually behind this whole thing. I also remember reading a chapter on consciousness and it basically stating that consciousness is just a result of our senses, sense object and awareness meeting (I don’t know if I got that part right but I believe it was along those lines). And there was a quote of someone approaching the Buddha with a question regarding universal consciousness which the Buddha told him was untrue.


So what is “self”? And if there is no self then what would reincarnate and how would some remember past lives?

Also what is the general idea of consciousness in Buddhism? Is it a belief in a universal consciousness or just a set of circumstances that have given us consciousness? "

This was [one of the responses](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oc7rc/have_you_ever_felt_a_deep_personal_connection_to/c3g4ot3/):

* * * * *

My last semester at a certain college I was assulted by a football player for walking where he was trying to drive (note he was 325lbs I was 120lbs), while unconscious on the ground I lived a different life.

I met a wonderful young lady, she made my heart skip and my face red, I pursued her for months and dispatched a few jerk boyfriends before I finally won her over, after two years we got married and almost immediately she bore me a daughter.

I had a great job and my wife didn't have to work outside of the house, when my daughter was two she [my wife] bore me a son. My son was the joy of my life, I would walk into his room every morning before I left for work and doted on him and my daughter.

One day while sitting on the couch I noticed that the perspective of the lamp was odd, like inverted. It was still in 3D but... just.. wrong. (It was a square lamp base, red with gold trim on 4 legs and a white square shade). I was transfixed, I couldn't look away from it. I stayed up all night staring at it, the next morning I didn't go to work, something was just not right about that lamp.

I stopped eating, I left the couch only to use the bathroom at first, soon I stopped that too as I wasn't eating or drinking. I stared at the fucking lamp for 3 days before my wife got really worried, she had someone come and try to talk to me, by this time my cognizance was breaking up and my wife was freaking out. She took the kids to her mother's house just before I had my epiphany.... the lamp is not real.... the house is not real, my wife, my kids... none of that is real... the last 10 years of my life are not fucking real!

The lamp started to grow wider and deeper, it was still inverted dimensions, it took up my entire perspective and all I could see was red, I heard voices, screams, all kinds of weird noises and I became aware of pain.... a fucking shit ton of pain... the first words I said were ""I'm missing teeth"" and opened my eyes. I was laying on my back on the sidewalk surrounded by people that I didn't know, lots were freaking out, I was completely confused.

at some point a cop scooped me up, dragged/walked me across the sidewalk and grass and threw me face down in the back of a cop car, I was still confused.

I was taken to the hospital by the cop (seems he didn't want to wait for the ambulance to arrive) and give CT scans and shit..

I went through about 3 years of horrid depression, I was grieving the loss of my wife and children and dealing with the knowledge that they never existed, I was scared that I was going insane as I would cry myself to sleep hoping I would see her in my dreams. I never have, but sometimes I see my son, usually just a glimpse out of my peripheral vision, he is perpetually 5 years old and I can never hear what he says.

* * * * *

An obvious question about this account is whether it's real. It has a distinctive greentext flavor, and those wise in the ways of the internet would rightly suspect it's one of those darned 4chans anons trolling us all again.

The answer is: does it matter?

**The very fact we can conceive of such a story constitutes an irreconcilable doubt of reality.**

If ""reality"" was undeniably ""real"", we could never doubt any aspect of it. However: we can. We can have an experience that seems entirely ""real"", yet at some later point is resolved to have been ""unreal"", such as a dream. At the very least, we can conceive of such experience. That, in fact, is enough.

Like the odd lampshade, this tiny speck of doubt, being irreconcilable, must grow to encompass and undermine our entire field of perception.

It becomes the Great Doubt as taught in the Zen tradition.

With this one story, the whole concept of ""real"" is toppled and dissolved.

It will be difficult to accept, since we are so attached to this precious concept of ""real"", and all the many pleasant ""real"" things it substantiates.

Thus, allow me to further explain:

Suppose we define a distinction between a **particle** and a **wave**, such that every phenomenon is **either** a particle **or** a wave. Then, if we are ever to encounter **even a single phenomenon** that is **both** a particle and a wave - this encounter will irrevocably invalidate our particle/wave distinction.

Likewise for the dichotomous distinction between ""real"" and ""unreal"". If we are ever in a dream, and there is no way for us to realize that we are in a dream, then we can never again be certain that at any moment we are not dreaming. If we can even conceive of such a dream that appears entirely real - then there is no ground for us to claim anything ""real"" as distinctive from ""unreal"". We just encountered a phenomenon that for all observable appearances is **both** ""real"" and ""unreal"", so there can be no distinction.

In fact the very definition of ""real"" loses all meaning, since it's founded upon a distinction between ""real"" and ""unreal"" which cannot be authenticated. At any moment, we can't determine if we, our lampshade, or every single aspect of our ""reality"" is ""real"" or ""unreal"". So what does the term even mean?  What does it mean for something to be ""real""?

This is like repeating a word until it loses all meaning. A silly exercise, right?  Yet it is exactly like mindfulness meditation, or staring at that lampshade. By bringing it repeatedly to our attention, we realize, first, that the glaze of meaning our consciousness coats it with - is just a conviction of our own fabrication. In fact, an artifact of our attachment. We attach to things, then confer upon them this honorary title of being ""real"". It means nothing.

You can do this exercise with a word, a concept, an idea, a feeling, an object. The great secret of the story is that you don't have to find an odd lampshade. It would certainly make the task easier. But if you are so inclined, feel free to meditate on your own personal and ordinary lampshade.

What does it mean for the lampshade to be ""real""?

**Our whole view of life is founded upon concepts that seem perfectly solid, yet have no validity at all.**

What is ""real""?  What does the definition even mean?

&gt; Now suppose that in the last month of the hot season a mirage were shimmering, and a man with good eyesight were to see it, observe it, &amp; appropriately examine it. To him—seeing it, observing it, &amp; appropriately examining it—it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would there be in a mirage? In the same way, a monk sees, observes, &amp; appropriately examines any perception that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near. To him—seeing it, observing it, &amp; appropriately examining it—it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would there be in perception?

-- Pheṇa Sutta - SN 22:95

So that's the secret of the story in the comment. And what's the secret of Buddhism?

That the Buddha isn't real."

Buddhism,Knowledge of the Dhamma is good but practicing the Dhamma is better,"“To Practice Dhamma can be difficult” - pg 47, Words from the Heart (abstracts from 75 Dhamma Talks), Venerable Sayadaw Dr Nandamalabhivamsa.

“Dhamma knowledge acquired by learning is not as strong and mature as the knowledge gained by actual practice.  The practice of Dhamma, even when it is known, can be very difficult because of the influence of the kilesa (mental defilement) such as lobha (craving), dosa (ill will) and mocha (ignorance).  When these are very strong, the knowledge or wisdom is very weak.  If the wisdom becomes stronger, kilesa such as lobha will become weak and then one can practice Dhamma.
 One often acquires the knowledge on how to develop wholesomeness by listening to Dhamma.  One performs Dana (generosity, offering), sila (morality) and Havana (mental development) to accumulate wholesomeness according to one’s knowledge.
 If one can apply the knowledge into action, then one can say that one practices Dhamma.  If one does not do so or does not get started to accumulate wholesomeness, even though one has the knowledge, one is said to know Dhamma but with difficulty to practice.”


My understand of the above quote, is that just because you know what the Dhamma says and can quote the different Suttas from memory, doesn’t mean you have a strong knowledge of the Dhamma.  In order to obtain a strong knowledge you must put what you learn from the Dhamma into actual practice.  You can do this by living your life morally well or following, at a minimum, the 5 precepts, reciting various suttas, and by meditation.  If you are not even actually practicing, then your knowledge is not as strong as one who practices Dhamma. 

I have recently met a monk who will not consider you to be Buddhist without at least practicing meditation.  This will be talked about in another post that I am currently drafting.  I felt that the above needed to be shared."
Buddhism,Buddhism definitely teaches sin right?,"It seems many buddhists in the west like to believe that Buddhism has no concept of sin, that there are only ""skillful"" and ""unskillful"" means.

It seems that there is objective morality that the Buddha was trying to teach here. Am I wrong?"

Buddhism,What is the difference between the mindful state and the flow state? Can you be mindful while being involved in intentional mental abstraction?,"I would very much like to pursue a career as a freelance programmer - as a highly introverted person it would be a dream job.

My only concern is that I fear spending much time lost in mental abstraction will prove unwise when it comes to spiritual development. I fear the time spent in a fragmented mind will make progress a lot slower, as my work will break my practice, rather then supplement it. Mainly because I don't see how I can possibly code whilst being mindful.

That being said, I am curious as to where the flow state comes into this. If I can build attention/concentration by means of coding, then there will be some benefit to it. But I'm not sure if it really is a wholesome state - the sense of identity is lost _in_ the activity, as the code writes itself. Now this happens rarely, but with time and practice it may be possible to recreate this often, at least apparently that is the case.

How does the flow state compare to mindfulness or meditation? Is it a wholesome state? And finally, is it really possible to avoid breaking the continuation of practice off the cushion when involved in mental abstraction? Are there any means by which I can not break the progression, or at least hinder it, when involved in a task requiring much mental abstraction?

Buddhism,Back to the basics,"I had a crisis of faith a few months ago. After being Buddhist nearly seven years I found myself at a critical state of dissatisfaction. I was at a low point where I couldn't motivate myself to practice the Dharma and I was indulging in harmful patterns of behavior like not exercising, meditating, eating well as well as doing things like smoking and oversleeping.

I made a post about in on here actually, and the best advice I got was to start over. Go back to square one and relearn everything instead of trying to pick up where I left off. I picked up the copy of the Dhammapada I've had for years unopened, and after days of reading and repeating, the spring of joy and contentedness inside me began to bubble up again. I quit smoking cold turkey, have been exercising an hour a day, meditating, and eating well. Everything has begin a dominoes style tumble back into place and I'm very grateful to this community for helping me mind my way back onto the middle road."
Buddhism,Buddha's enlightenment: Was Buddha's conquest of Mara an allegorical device or a literal event?,"This confuses me a little because Buddha spoke only truth (to me, and to many others). I have never doubted a word ascribed to him. I used to struggle with the notion of 'hell-beings' and 'hungry ghosts' but now I see them as 'entities' as modern people describe them. I used to think the 'gods' were God (was born Hindu) but I found out they are beings from higher worlds and realms, probably ETs.

Buddha was beyond all their influence, he was AWAKE. I've been told that as a person ascends or awakens, dark entities try to sabotage them and stop them from continuing. This sounds just like what happened to Siddhartha Gautama, the man who became the Buddha. 

I could go into much more detail but we would be digressing. I just want to know how others are interpreting this story. Is it allegorical to you or factual? I used to think it was allegorical but I think it is factual now based on things I have started to experience and discussed with others. 

May all beings be free of suffering and have the causes of happiness :) "

Buddhism,New to buddhism,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

Just introducing myself!

&amp;#x200B;

I was brought up a Christian and recently made a decision for myself to follow Buddhism as the spiritual framework for my life. I researched many religions, and Buddhism is the only one that really resonates with me to the core. The idea of listening to wisdom others have gained from their own lives and attempting to gain wisdom from the experiences that I have personally gone through by reflecting with meditation seems a practical and peaceful way of acting productively in the world. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have read some of the quran, the hadith, and a lot of the bible, however the idea of a holy text that was sacred and the idea of following an all powerful being never appealed to me.  I like to think for myself and I like it when others think for themselves too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been meditating for a long time now, I'd say probably close to a year so it's not like that aspect is new. I think I was acting as a Buddhist without explicitly identifying as one! It's nice to find a framework that fits and guide's my natural spiritual instincts.

&amp;#x200B;

To gaining and sharing wisdom,

Buddhism,places/ways to meditate,"hi everyone, not entirely new to buddhism (altho sorta) but let me cut to the nitty gritty... Im looking for a good place to meditate in peace. I prefer sitting in seza for one. The issue i am having is that i have a dog that LOVES to be around me. all the time. I live in a small place that if i were to put him in his kennel, no matter what he will see me and get mad and bark lol.

&amp;#x200B;

So far my best place to meditate has actually been in my shower. problem: i dont have an unlimited supply of hot water. do you guys have a specific place you like to meditate? on the toilet perhaps? im asking both out of curiousity and idea generation.

Buddhism,I will be going to a Tibetan Buddhist center tomorrow. I’ll be going for a Dakini Day practice. Something to do with Throma Nagmo.

Buddhism,Am I allowed in Buddhism to not want to be friends with someone?,"I feel rather negative even thinking this way, and I am constantly reminding myself that things just are and that I do not need to pass judgment on them. But I have been noticing that there are times when other people who I find unpleasant to be around, want to be around me, and I often relent because I think maybe I am just being closed minded, maybe if I apply compassion then things will surprise me for the better.

&amp;#x200B;

Not the case though, many times. In one case there is a friend that only reaches out when they need something. Additionally they are negative when we are together and I just end up feeling bad about myself. 

This is the main reason for this post. I honestly don't want to spend time with this person. How does Buddhism approach this kind of thing? What can I learn from this experience?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you."

Buddhism,Reincarnation and afterlife,What exactly are Buddhist views on reincarnation and afterlife? Why must we end cycles of birth and death?

Buddhism,About Siddartha book by Herman Hess,"Hello,
This is my first post in this sub,
I was raised 100% catholic. 
And since young I wanted to learn more about Buddhist teachings. 
I have just read [siddartha](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0553208845/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_L1FaCbKGFQBSS), I loved this book but I wanted to ask how close is this novel to the life of Buddha. When I finished the book I remembered that buddha spent time meditating under a tree but this was not mentioned at all in this book.
Forgive my ignorance but I wanted to start learning somewhere and I thought that reading his story would be a good place to start.
Finally, what book can you recommend for me (a beginner)

Buddhism,What is the saying regarding samsara as being like the reflection in a mirror,"As in, samsara is there - it can be seen, but it is not substantial, like the reflection in a mirror.

Could anyone point me in the right direction?"
Buddhism,"Truths, beliefs and attitudes that help with self-forgiveness/self trust?","Long ago, I did some pretty crummy things. And because I've developed spiritually, and emotionally, I've come to realize just how bad these things were. Back when I did these things I had really poor self control and was constantly in a state of masochism, self hatred and high anxiety.

Flash forward to now, I have good self control, almost too much at times, because I don't trust myself. These things haunt me, and I have difficulty letting it go. I often go through guilt and shame about it all. Sometimes I feel compassion and empathy for those I've hurt, and sometimes sorrow and feeling disturbed by it all. 

I've been practicing forgiveness meditation periodically. Basically I offer myself forgiveness for what I've done, and try to give myself understanding for the reasons I did such things, and try to realize that I'm a different person now. But it doesn't seem to be enough.

I guess sometimes I still have darker impulses, although they are much much more rare. This is a contributing factor to not trusting myself. Sometimes these things haunt me so much, and I have so much moral fear that I can't really live in the present moment much at all, because I'm trying to go over rules of ethics that will prevent me from doing such things again.

Anyways, I wanted to write a meditation/prayer to recite often, to help improve my attitudes on this front and would like some input on what things help you guys forgive yourselves? Thanks!

Buddhism,"Personally, I was a Buddhist, before briefly becoming an Atheist then now I’m agnostic because i’ve become so receptive of the idea of Buddhism","As my parents were Buddhists, I was raised Buddhist in my household. Growing up, was really really tough. My mom had cancer when i was at the age of 11, and I somehow took it upon myself that I was to blame. Thankfully, she survived. Hence, I developed mental disorders in the form of bipolar disorder. My heart was always heavy and i always only wanted to die. Attempted suicide thrice too. However I joined my mom in one of her meditation sessions a few days back, and i fell into a “deep sleep” afterwards. A higher power as i would describe it, told me to live a life with no regrets, and somehow that benevolence i felt from that sentence made me feel really enlightened like a huge burden has been removed off of me. I took a huge step and apologised to my parents for the troubles i’ve caused them and promised them I’ll get my life together again. I felt like it was all because of that voice, that I heard while meditating. That i felt clear of what I had to do, I’ve never felt more enlightened and in control.

Buddhism,Why 'Knowing What You Need' is an important part of meditation practice,"Hi everyone, my name is Jesse and I have been studying and practicing Esoteric Buddhist traditions for the past 10 years under a master of Buddhism.

This episode is the first in a series that examines deeper the elements of knowledge and investigation as part of meditation practice - how to break apart and understand the various afflictions of mind that hinder our practice, and how it's important to know what we need in order to grow.

Hope you enjoy! :)

Buddhism,I don't understand incarnation and anatman," 
I feel like turning to Buddhism as a way to develop compassion and getting free from stress and anxiety. However I am struggling with part of the concepts and this prevents me from going further... For example, I don't understand the sentences that ""phenomenon are non existent, non real and only illusions"" and the concept of anatman: if phenomenon and people are unreal, how can we help them, interact with them? What should I understand by ""there is no I""? I mean what then defines someone's personality, it's opinions, reactions,... ? And then how can we say that there is rebirth if there is no I? By the way, how do you combine a scientific vision of the world with the idea of rebirth and incarnation, since science says that once you're dead, you're just dead and that's. Moreover I understood the Buddha said we shouldn't accept something just out of beliefs, without having experienced it and seen it as true... Which is obviously not the case with the afterlife??

As a concrete example, could someone explain the meaning ""the 14th Dalai Lama is an incarnation of the 13th""? What's the difference between the two then? 

I guess I sound very confused, but that's the case;-) Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you all"

 A first year student of mine in my Samatha/Vipassana meditation class recently approached me after class and asked if he could schedule a meeting with me to ask some questions, but i had time before the next class so i just let him ask them right there. 

His questions were aimed at becoming a stream-enterer, and after about 30 minutes of questions and answers he left feeling I think a little disheartened by the necessary meditation, progress, and study needed for such a feat.

Another thing I have found is that many of my students who I know to be meditators even before my classes have never even heard of stream-entry or becming a non-returner. 

So my question is , how many of you are concerned with stream-entry in this lifetime or how many of you have never even heard of it? thank you so much if you take the time to answer and have a wonderful day"

Speaking personally, with hindsight: I am grateful that my own ""disillusionment"" came to a head as early as it did, before the seeds of resentment could establish themselves. It's no great leap to see disillusionment itself as a quintessential Buddhist value, temporarily clearing the path of obstructions. That won't make you any less ""lost""-- those obstructions were, after all, kind of useful as landmarks or signposts. 

I think that's a good time to scratch your head and say: ""I need to learn more.""

Buddhism,"I am not interested in doing anything at all, included meditation, so I just wile the time away","As a neet transitioning out of 'neetdom', practicing meta in order to get out of extreme coldness and apathy. I have a ridiculous amount of free time on my hands. I typically practice walking meditation 1-2 hours a day, but once I'm done, I have absolutely nothing to do. 

I don't have passions, pursuits, or hobbies. I'm simply not interested in doing anything. So instead I while the time away online, feeling mentally blocked from meditating anymore, lost in mental confusion and filled with bizarre longing for absolutely nothing at all.

I'm not sure what to do with my time. As I said, nothing at all interests me, so I just while away the time, but I feel this is terribly wasteful. It is true this lack of interest may be due to apathy arising from years long depression and mental 'dryness', but it could be years before loving-kindness meditation fully kindles the fires of aspiration.

In the meantime, what on earth do I do??"

* I can only interview someone who was born outside of the US,
* I can only interview someone who moved to the country after their 16th birthday,
* And I can only interview someone that practices a different religion that myself.

Buddhism,Some Insights While Reading the Bardo Thodol - On Perceiving the Nature of Impermanence,"The Mind's ability to perceive the nature of impermanence with respect to phenomena requires the immediate awareness of both the arising and the cessation, the beginning and the end, the appearing and the vanishing, of phenomena within the Eye of the Mind. On a fundamental level of Being, we are re-conceptualizing the nature of phenomena according to its entire timeline. On a psychological level, it causes the Mind to redefine phenomena to include its ultimate demise, away from defining it purely upon our current sense of experience of it, which is what gives it its sense of permanence. And in doing so, we extinguish our sense of time with respect to experiencing phenomena, allowing us to simply dwell within pure consciousness, our timeless sense of our own Mind. 


Even though these sensations arise, we observe them from a distance, without self-identification, without entanglement, without Attachment. This enables the Mind to apprehend phenomena where, lacking permanence and a sense of inherent reality, there is a sense of dispassion with respect to it. This opens up for us the awareness of the potential of experiencing the world in a different way, in a way where we learn that we do not have to be angry in situations that are typically associated with anger, or envious in situations that are commonly associated with envy, and so on. There is no need to attach those sorts of negative meanings to events in life, that it is wholly possible to interpret the world in a way that is radically different from what is perhaps more commonly done, in accordance with equanimity.


The Mind's ability to skillfully perceive impermanence in this world will determine its ability to do so in the Bardo of death. This world here is like a place of preparation. With respect to the Darkness of Ignorance and the line of trauma that runs through the course of sentient beings, the knowledge of impermanence is the means by which trauma is overcome. Beyond the emptiness and voidness that we fear lies beyond the pretense of a material self, there is the Radiant Pure White Light, it is the Natural Mind. "
Buddhism,Is buddhism compatible with communism?,"I’ve recently converted to buddhism,I think what the Buddha taught is great ans beautiful,it inspired me to try and become better through following the noble eighfold path and other of the buddhas teachings. I’ve read What the Buddha Taught and other books. 

However,his teachings seem to always mention “making a living” and a money-based mode of production. However,I’ve always been a communist. 

I believe overthrow of the rich through revolution would be self-defence,and that the people’s welfare would be better under it. No I don’t support the atrocities made under communism.

Buddhism,Advice for negative life circumstances/environments?,"Hey everyone. I wanted to post this here because I've seen some very helpful replies to questions of a similar nature and could do with some advice from someone wiser and further along the path than myself.

So, I'm not a Buddhist, but for a few years I've been learning about Buddhism/Yoga/Zen etc, practicing and applying what I've understood and I've grown a consistent meditation practice which has been somewhat life changing. 

However, I currently have a problem: my life! To cut a long story short, I'm in a bit of a transitional stage and since unexpectedly coming back home about 7 months ago, I'll have to continue living at home with my parents (I'm in my 30's) until sometime next year.

This is tricky for a number of reasons, but ultimately my parents are both somewhat toxic to be around: the atmosphere at home can be very depressing, we have totally different ways of looking at life, it's hard to relax, always lots of noise and generally some kind of drama and/or arguing going on in their life. I feel trapped, and it's like their negativity energy is seeping into my own being. It's hard to have my own space to just 'be'.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now this is where I'm struggling**: I understand all of this is  a 'story', temporary thoughts, feelings and emotions within the mind. I know my situation is also temporary and due to change sometime next year. And some days, I feel really content and somewhat unaffected by the story and all the external drama around me (including a job I don't get much satisfaction from, a shitty social life, poor finances, cold dark winter days etc). On those days, I experience how my spiritual practice is working in my day to day life.

But some days, it's harder. I try to be present, I know the mental forms are not 'me', and my story is not me either. But when you truly dislike where you're living and who you're living with and are ambitious for a totally different life which feels like it's on the horizon, how do you integrate it all? 

I think I correctly understand that peace and happiness don't come from outside circumstances, but I sure as hell know I was happier when I wasn't living back at home...I mean, monks choose monastic life for a reason right? And it's natural to not want to be living with your parents at this age...

Anyway, this was a bit of a ramble so any advice whatsoever is welcome. I'm considering booking a short break this weekend just to get away for a bit to 'escape the story' but know that's only a temporary fix to a temporary problem...

Buddhism,Notion of the self,"Many people seem to think that ""ego"" is something to be destroyed as if it's something real and malicious. There's this ingrained sense that ""self"" is an illusion. I don't think ego is something to be destroyed nor do I agree with the notion that ""self"" is an illusion.  Ego is just a manifestation of your beliefs about yourself. Beliefs that can be altered. Beliefs that  experiences of your life alter. Beliefs that realizing that you are not separate from the experience alters. I don't think ego is something that you can get rid of in the first place. Calling self an illusion is quite misleading in itself. Self is a process. Buddha did not say ""No self"". Instead he said ""Not self"" implying self is not what it seems. Awakening leads to a direct realization that our view of self was wrong all along. However it does not indicate that you are not a person and that everything you know about yourself is an illusion. You are still a person IMO. Just blindly shifting your identity to the ""higher self"" and trying to kill your ego is not healthy. Whatever you resist, persists. Ego is not your enemy. Its just  manifestation of your deepest beliefs about yourself. Its something to be integrated in the process. Killing your ego is the most unspiritual endeavor in my opinion. 
Let's talk more what exactly is an ego and self."

Buddhism,Burning down the hermit's hut,"So I just finished re-reading Robert Aitken's Mind of Clover and of everything I've read  what struck me the most of this entire book was The Withered Tree koan. It goes something as follows 

&gt;There was an old woman who supported a hermit. For twenty years she always had a girl, sixteen or seventeen years old, take the hermit his food and wait on him.

&gt;One day she told the girl to give the monk a close hug and ask, “What do you feel just now?”

&gt;The hermit responded,

&gt;An old tree on a cold cliff;
Midwinter – no warmth.

&gt;The girl went back and told this to the old woman. The woman said, “For twenty years I’ve supported this vulgar good-for-nothing!” So saying, she threw the monk out and burned down the hermitage.

How many of us are aspiring to be the hermit that is far removed from the graspings of the world? Removed from the very trappings that many consider an essential part of the human experience. I stumble into this pitfall very often and constantly need to remind myself about the context of various ideas and how they don't necessarily apply to my situation. For example, most literature I read on Buddhism or Zen is written by monks or Zen masters, titles I'll never have in this lifetime because I'm married with children and very much engaged in the suffering in the world. I'm a meat eater by necessity because my job is very demanding both physically and mentally and a lack of high energy foods makes me very sluggish and feeling weak and unable to perform my duties to my greatest ability. 

However, there was a time I refrained from eating meat, a time I withdrew from my wife's advances, a time I meant to withdraw from the rat race of the corporate world, a time I shunned friends and deleted all of my social media accounts, a time I refrained from speaking, all just so I could retire to a hut in the woods and leave the world to fall in ruin around me.......but that's not where you guys need me is it? In doing these things I am no different than that vulgar hermit who has grown cold and bitter in his attempts to detach from the world. I have not developed compassion and for this I am failing all of you.

Buddhism,Enlightenment and relief,"Could the **feeling** of enlightenment be akin to relief? For example, our sense of self is not just an identity we attach to, but it's a sort of project, preoccupation, an activity that we take to be of the utmost importance.

Important projects are very stressful. Have you ever had a job where you felt a sense of relief whenever you could finally drop the load and take a breather once the task or shift has ended? Previously you were engrossed in the stressful task, a task which had (whether real or imagined) vast consequences if done wrong. Afterward, when you finally clocked out, you felt so good! You got that rush of relief because you didn't have to do the thing anymore. 

If we take that analogy to the project of the self, we see that we are so worried and stressed about this task we are performing. Our being is an absolute issue for us (in Heideggerian terms). But what if this project, and the rationale behind it, isn't really a big deal? That you can drop the load and actually be okay? We work on ourselves because we think we won't be okay if we didn't, and so we cling to our identity and its project. 

All day today I was so stressed and placed too much importance on little things. I decided to drop the significance of these things and found myself feeling good and found myself to actually not be in a worse state (that I hypothetically thought I would be in if I didn't tend to those things).

Could enlightenment be like this anology? And that if we drop this project/task of self, that we would feel that relief because we indeed are okay and have been from the beginning? Hope this makes sense."

Can I perform a sukhavati ceremony myself or will I need a nun or a monk to do it?  "

Buddhism,"I'm having a hard time reconciling these two stories, what am I missing?","I cannot remember if it was Ananda or someone else, but in one story, it's said that one of the monks had his karma damaged because in a past life, he killed a pirate that stumbled upon his ship in order to keep the crew safe.

However, in another story, Ananda is guarding a tent or cave that Siddhartha is in, and he tries to shoo Mara, but Siddhartha surprises Ananda by welcoming both of them inside, where Mara receives the best seat. The message is supposedly to not be afraid of others being let in if they further your pursuit. Someone else can probably phrase it better.

So how does one appreciate the latter if the forces that follow, namely karma, don't discriminate circumstances?"

Buddhism,How to heal from past abuse and how to improve my practice. Looking for input.,"For those who want to get to the point of why I'm posting on /r/buddhism, paragraph 5 and on is about that. The rest is the background on why I'm posting in the first place and to look for similar cases to mine. The last paragraph explains what I wish to get out of this post. Thank you.

I was abused growing up. To some it may be considered mild, but whenever I did something wrong, instead of telling me why and talking to me about it, my dad would yell at the top of his lungs at me, even when I was crying he persisted. If I had something personal I needed to get off my chest, I had to risk judgement of my parents at the very least, if not yelling which scared the hell out of me and made me fearful of my father even to this day (I'm 23). My dad would spy on me, and made me have my desk across from the door to make sure I wasn't doing anything ""wrong"", censor what information I could access through content filtering programs. If I wanted to learn something new, I needed to go to my dad to unblock the website (they used whitelisting, so everything must be approved or it is blocked by default). I never felt any sense of freedom except when I could hide it.

My mom was judgemental as well. She told me multiple times that I could come to her if I had a problem, that what I shared was between me and her, but every single time she told my dad and I would get yelled at. Whenever I was hurt by her actions, she blamed me for being the cause. Even when I wrote a long email to her trying to explain to her the harm she caused to me, she never admitted fault. It was always my fault.

My dad always wonders why I never go to him for help, and for years I wasn't sure either. My mom thinks I'm ungrateful because she provides financial support. I've only relatively recently put the pieces of the puzzle together. Because of these experiences, I never was able to bond with them and I feel broken and betrayed because of past experiences. I can never go to them for help, I do not feel loved by them, and to this day I have problems with anxiety, depression, constant confusion, and inability to make decisions without questioning them and often deciding that my judgements couldn't be trusted (my parents always told me I was wrong. I was never ""right"" in their eyes).

Despite all of this, I'm very social, have a positive outlook on life and have great, understanding friends that I can trust.If it wasn't for my friends, I would be much worse off. They allowed me to understand my abuse, that I wasn't always wrong, always at fault, always stupid, etc.. To this day, I have incredible anger towards my parents for leading me to be so broken as an adult. Interacting with them to this day feels like I'm being poisoned. I want to get away from them, lead my life through my own actions. But due to their past actions, it's very hard.

I had discovered Buddhism about a year ago. From reading a few books on the subject (as well as books on anxiety, depression, and ADHD which I also have), I have learned that I alone am responsible for my own actions and future, and while other people may have influenced me in the past, it can all be fixed. This knowledge is very empowering and I know I can use it to become better, to lead a better life for myself and those around me (especially my friends who I love dearly).

But even though I understand that it is in my own power to solve these issues I have, it's still so very hard. In no way am I making an excuse for inaction on my part or that I am a helpless victim, far from it. I just wanted to share these feelings I've had bottled up inside me for so many years. I wanted to see how other people here have dealt with similar feelings and experiences. This post also has another purpose which is to get all my thoughts out so I can better understand myself and experiences, using this knowledge to create positive change in my life.

Through meditation, I *have* noticed my ability to handle my emotions have improved, but despite keeping to a habit of at least 5 minutes per day of meditation (recently I've been able to do 10 minute sessions or more and I do a few of these per day), the improvement is slow, and my anxiety, and depression still criple me. Even with mindfulness, my thoughts are cloudly, it's difficult to focus. Perhaps it's because I don't practice enough mindfulness through the day. I'm not entirely sure.

As for what I am looking for, I want to hear how others here have dealt with similar circumstances and to get advice on how to improve my mindfulness and meditation practice. Thank you for reading. I appreciate it."
Buddhism,The Banality of Dukkha,"I had a good day. I've been four months without a car. It's been nice to get to know my large midwestern city on a street by neighborhood level, and walking six or more miles a day for work has been quite a lot of fun. But now that's over because I got myself a car. It worked out surprisingly well too. I've never been one to carry debt. No credit cards ever. No loans from the bank or a retailer. Just my student loans. This has led me to have a much lower credit score than I would like, which I assumed would keep me from getting a nice new ride. A hooptie, I thought, was in my future. Turns out that wasn't the case and long story short I have a very nice new car, and a very sizable new loan to go along with. I'm very happy and excited. For instance, I get to go to the Zen center I've been pining to check out for months. And dates! I get to go on dates again!

Life is suffering, though. We all know this, and as I lie in bed unwinding and settling down the dread and fear and guilt of the whole process arises within me. I like my new car, but now I'm beholden to it. I have taken on my largest financial responsibility since college and it's going to be a burden of some sort at least for the next few years.

Our joys are also our sadness. The choices we make to extend our freedom also bind us. Dread and the simple unsatisfactory nature of life hovers over everything we do, even those things that make us happy. That's ok too. We're not all going to be monks after all. It's fine to want things and get them, but dukkha increases in direct proportion to whatever it is we end up collecting. I'm reminding myself to be grateful for my good fortune, but not to forget what the real work is."

Buddhism,How can I care about life?,"I've become incredibly disillusioned with school in my final year of it. I used to be extremely conscientious (partially due to a long forgotten period of OCD) but in the last couple of years have done a complete reversal.

I cannot bring myself to work.

It's not even a matter of procrastination, simply an 'I really don't care about how my future goes at this point'. I've been dealing dealing with depression most of my life but my recently adopted 'self-destructive' habits have done more for my mental health than being a good student ever did. I'm no longer anywhere near as stressed as I used to be about work, I'm meeting loads of new people through partying most weekends and I'm making the trudge through school a damn-sight more interesting by being a dick to teachers who are dicks to me rather than vying to please them like I used to. The only thing is I've yet to do more than a couple (and I mean literally a couple) of rushed, 20 minute essays since the start of September.

I'm less depressed than I used to be, but I'm far from happy. Yes, I've gone from nervous wreck to not giving a shit about anything but at this stage I really want to feel something other than making-out, alcohol, weed and music.

Where is this care for my future? What buddhist teaching can help me get it back? I meditate daily which, again has helped, but still led to general apathy about staying alive.

I suppose this post has become more of a 'how can I care about life?' than the original title of 'Any Buddhist teachings on motivation?'

Buddhism,"I am suffering. I'm full of anger, hatred and fear. I lack courage.","Hi,

I am full of anger, hatred an fear. I get annoyed easily. People are unpolite. People are rude. I try to be a good civillian. People say ""Be nice. Be compassionate"" and I end up supressing my hatred and disapproval towards peoples behavior.

1. At the subway at 7am. Everybody is in silence. And there is a guy with loud music. I noticed how I was getting angry, but didn't say anything.

2. Walking around the street, a guy bumps into me. Looks at me as it were my fault when it wasnt, and he keeps walking without saying sorry

3. I have a small buddha statue in my office desk. Everyday I come the statue is laid down. It's the cleaning lady. I understand she might be having a bad day or something but I get angry. But people say ""Be nice. Don't be angry""

How can I not be angry when people are doing this things?!

On the other hand I am afraid that someone confrontational will want to start a fight or if someone kicks me out from my job if I confront the cleaning lady.

I am suffering a lot. Please, help.

I sometimes feel like the problem is in me, but on the other hand I think I lack courage and that I have to stand up for myself.

In fact, today I had a dream of me being a doormat. And I felt very disturbed.

Buddhism,"How should I let go of an obsessive, negative mindset?","Hello. I'd like advice on how one should let go of an obsessive, negative mindset.

To be more specific, I've realised along the years that my thoughts inevitably drift back to a few pivotal moments in which I've made a decision that I've regretted and how much better/wholesome my life would have been had I made a different choice. Perhaps some examples would be the choice of school I went to the actions which have soured some of my relationships. I suppose my thoughts also drift towards the direction of regretting not having made use of my time to the fullest potential (i guess in a way squandering whatever chance/opportunities i was given to improve). I guess the final kicker is that I'm always harping on the unjust segments of society, be it in the differences in living standards between classes, et cetera. This might seem like a good-ish thing but I don't think it comes from a place of loving-kindness in my case but rather from a place of ego in which I feel wronged as I was on what I perceived to be the receiving end of injustice.

I'm really tired of it all and I'd just like to settle into a position where I suppose my thoughts don't revolve around toxic mindsets for the rest of my life. To this end, I've tried finding solace in the Dharma but I think I'd appreciate the advice of people who have gone through a period such as this just as well."
Buddhism,How is anatman supposed to be understood?,"The teach of no-self seems to be quite a difficult one to properly grasp. This is how I'm conceptualizing it at the moment, please let me know what you all think and whether this is accurate. To understand what the Buddha was getting at, we need to understand what is meant by Atman. From my very basic understanding of Hinduism, Atman is the unchanging essence or soul of a person. The goal is to realize and unite with the intrinsic soul within us. What the Buddha is saying by anatman, is that there is no unchanging soul within us. We change with everything else based on the prior and present condition and if there is a soul it is also changing. 

This seems quite different from how I originally understood the idea of no-self, and likely how many people that don't know Eastern concepts think about no-self. Hearing this, one might think there is no person at all. That we are only material and that our awareness is just an arising phenomenon. This conception seems to have a very hard timing fitting in with other Buddhist notions of liberation, different starts of awareness, and especially rebirth. If there really was no person to experience, then there is no one to be enlightened, similarly there is no one to be reborn. 

So what I'm getting at is that there is a self but this self contains no eternally unchanging aspect. The self I am in this moment will be completely different from a future self. 

Is this understanding closer to what Buddhism is actually trying to convey or is this incorrect? When delving into this concept it seems we need to understand the Hindi idea the Buddha was originally addressing. Any readings or talks would also be appreciated. I don't mean for this to be an explanation of the concept, just want to raise this conception as a basis for scrutiny. Thanks!"

I have had zero motivation to meditate, to run, to eat well. I'm even struggling with the motivation to self destruct (via self harm, purposely getting fired, arguments with those close to me), as has been a consistent feeling throughout previous depressive bouts. This time I'm not engaging in physical self harm, but I am indulging the desire to drink and smoke, and a familiar feeling is back - that even though I know what I'm doing I don't care and actively seem to be encouraging it. 


I feel like this could be Seasonal Affective Disorder kicking in and re aggravating symptoms of depression I'd mitigated with meditation and better lifestyle choices. I can't get a Dr's appointment for two weeks and even when we do meet, I feel that all my options are going to involve spending money I don't have (bright light) or taking medication (Prozac over a 10 month period made my depression significantly worse in the past).

Buddhism,Someone please change my mind about Buddhism,"This is my first time posting here. I have to admit, due to my past encounter with people who claimed to be Buddhist who pushed a ""holier-than-thou"" attitude upon me, I have a pretty warped view of Buddhism as a faith that compounds guilt and suffering upon people (at least people like me) like Catholicism is purported to. And I just admitted this view is warped, but I'm not seeing much evidence right now that will change my mind. That's why I'm making this Reddit post, to get help in correcting my thinking about Buddhism.

The previous Buddhists I engaged with in some form were all about the modern day injustices inherent in Western society. I recognize there are many injustices, yes, but these people kept harping upon my role in perpetuating them just by living my modern day life in this society. This was back in college, and my life hasn't gotten any better since then. I've had mental health maladies back then and still do now, but I'm not going to get into those specific issues as I know it's against this Subreddit's rules. But the reason I bring them up is because I'm one of the people who ***needs*** help, not someone who is in a position to help others. I keep reading on Buddhist forums about people who are so fed up with Western society that they move to the opposite side of the globe to soothe their conscience; meanwhile I'm barely living above the poverty level and can't even dream of having the money to do that myself.

How am I supposed to help others when I can't even help myself? I can't seem to get an answer to that question from Buddhism, but maybe I've been looking in the wrong places. Please help me correct my thinking on Buddhism, as there's got to be more to it than the imposition of guilt and shame."

Buddhism,"A question on rebirth (I know, another one, I'm sorry)","I've been reading as many of the responses on r/Buddhism explaining rebirth in buddhist tradition and have come across a recurring explaining analogy that if anything can be used more closely to explain a functionalist theory of mind.

The analogy (I'm sure you'll recognise) is as follows: *let a flame represent a beings consciousness, it is sustained by the combustion (a process on) of wax in the presence of oxygen (some matter). The brain (and other physical aspects if consciousness such as sensory organs) is represented here by the wax, and the oxygen is the stimulus. The analogy continues by saying that the atoms of wax oxygen and other gases at any point in time T_x, are different to those at T_(x+n) as long as n!=0. And finishes by comparing transferring the flame to another candle.*

The problem I have here is that this analogy actuslly perfectly fits a monist (functionalist/pysicalist/materialist) model of consciousness. Imagine the flame burning out, this particular flame (this particular conscious being) is now dead, the material causes of consciousness have ceased and so has the consciousness itself (the flame has gone out). It is still possible to light another candle, consciousness in the abstract (the idea of fire) has not been destroyed, but that particular flame has. Conservation of mass/energy occurs, but there is no conservation of coherent informstion (the informstion still exists as knowing the position and velocity of every particle in the room would allow you to know about the candle, but it's not in a coherent manner - a conscious being would have to put considerable effort into collecting it). 

Lighting another candle doesn't have any actual connection with the candle that went out, other than in the Homo Sapiens (or any other sufficiently intelligent being) perception of reality equating the two in a general sense, in that they are composed of the same thing.


In addition to this specific response, I would like to ask some questions if I may. How does rebirth occur - what is the causal process? How is it determined which person is rebirthed into which other person/being? Obviously there's no abrahamic God making decisions, so by what process is the allocation determined? Is rebirth constrained to this planet? Given the size of the observable universe its highly likely some manner of life exists, and probably at least at a level equivalent to Earth's plants or animals. So does rebirth occur across intergalactic distances? And finally, I guess the most important, what is it that is reborn. What is the composition of the entity that continues after death, what is its nature and how did it come to be? "
Buddhism,Geshe Tashi Tsering – Buddhism in the Next 100 Years,
Buddhism,Incredibly stressed about visiting the sangha,"Born and raised buddhist here. I rarely visited any temple as a kid due to living in a rural and pretty isolated area, so after moving to the city, I was pretty excited to be close to a variety of temples from a variety of different schools. One of my friends here goes to a Jodo Shinshu temple on occasion, and even though it\`s not my tradition (Pure Land), everyone is so nice and I love going with him. The only problem is that he doesn\`t go as often as I want to go, and it\`s a huge panic inducing struggle going without someone. 

I guess I\`m just afraid of feeling like I don\`t belong there or feeling like an invader. This has literally never been the case when I do visit, but for some reason I can\`t shake the feeling. I\`m also afraid that I\`ll get there and not know what to do or mess some custom up, which again is ridiculous because I\`ve been before and I know the ropes. At the same time, not visiting the sangha also stresses me out because I feel like I\`m missing an opportunity to learn and grow. 

Has anyone else felt this way when visiting a temple for the first time? Do you have any advice?

Buddhism,What is the best trick to trick your mind into doing meditation?,"I've read a lot of texts on Vipassana and Samatha meditation. I've even attended a 10 day course at a meditation center.

However, I haven't been practicing it lately, my problem is sheer procrastination. I do it once in a while (like after a week or fortnight) but then unable to continue it. I tell myself almost every day that ""tomorrow it is, I shall do it!"" but unable to keep the promise to myself.  How do I trick my mind into doing it regularly?"
Buddhism,Mother’s Death,"My mother just recently passed. She wasn’t a devout Buddhist but she followed and Buddhism brought her a lot of comfort over these last years. 
 
My question is.. what does Buddhism say about death? As I am not religious and I am struggling with her passing and I would like to know what she believed was happening and will happen."
Buddhism,I have so many questions.,"I've been interested in Buddhism for a while. It seemed peaceful and less terrifying than many alternatives. So I've been reading, mostly Brad Warner; his writing style is easier for me to follow and understand and I've been watching his videos on YouTube. 

I'm still confused about zazen though. Are my eyes supposed to be open or shut? Does it matter? 

What's the purpose of a home shrine? Do only certain schools set them up, or...?

Also the nearest temple to me is an hour away and since I dont drive it's almost impossible for me to get to it, if I can't get to one is watching YouTube talks and reading books similar enough or is going to a temple different and really important? 
I feel like there's so much information out there, I'm kinda drowning in it lol. "
Buddhism,Questions about Buddhism,"I am still searching for a religion and I do believe Buddhism is a good fit. So I really want chances to learn more about Buddhism and how I can marry it to my current beliefs about spirituality. I’m a little bit perrenial and I do believe in things like LOA and other things. I’m just having a hard time with the spiritualist/perrenial community lately as they are saying they are getting a little too superstitious for me and I’m young(15) and still on a long spiritual journey. I want to journey into spirituality without superstition just belief and being able to ask questions like Buddhism offers. I also want to reach enlightenment some day. So, what is Buddhism about? 

I’ve read siddartha Gautama’s story and I agree with him a lot overall. I am a huge meditator as well and I love the anti-dogma of the religion as I don’t believe in dogma. "
Buddhism,Anyone familiar with Zen centers in Metro Detroit?,"I am looking to go to a Zen center in my area. I have already tried a Theravada center, Buddhist Meditation Center  - Watpaknam in Sterling Heights, MI, and everything was great. I am now learning more toward Zen, and there are a couple centers near me that I wondered if anyone had any experiences with. I may sound paranoid, but I just want to find a legitimate Zen center that focuses on the Buddha's teachings and is not trying to be too western.

&amp;#x200B;

Dharma Gate Zen Center in Troy, MI. [https://dharmagatezen.org](https://dharmagatezen.org). This is described as a Korean/Japanese Zen blend for a western audience. The monk there was ordained at Seonamsa monastery in South Korea. Everything seems pretty normal. They follow the four noble truths, standard Zen stuff, etc. They mention fees for a membership for running the building, but that you won't be turned away for financial reasons. I assume this is standard to keep everything running, but just wanted to make sure.

&amp;#x200B;

Muddy Water Zen in Royal Oak, MI. [http://www.muddywaterzen.com](http://www.muddywaterzen.com). It says it is a Korean Taego Zen practice. Everything seems normal, but again they talk about adapting to a western audience. Also, they have a section on their website about taking the precepts. Forgive me if this is a dumb question, but does that mean to become a monk there or something? Because it mentions paying $108 for a precept ceremony and doing 3000 prostrations prior to this ceremony. I am totally ignorant, but is the fee just for becoming a monk?

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully some of you have been to one or both of these places and can shed some light. I know this sounds very condescending but this is not how I mean, I just want to find a legitimate Zen center that isn't a western place trying to just meditate for a few minutes and connect with nature. I want an actual teacher as a layman, and I just want to make sure that is what I am getting. Thanks!"
Buddhism,Question About Tradtions/Sects,"I have been reading more and more about Buddhism recently, it's something I always had a basic knowledge of but I have started to actually listen to and read some of the Scriptures (Diamond Sutra etc) and listen to talks as well as really think about the practices and teachings and how I could apply them to my life.  


As I have read more I have also come across such a Vastness of Traditions and Linieages and while I was always aware that Buddhism like any religion has different sects I don't think I appreciated just how fragmented it was.  


That said, what is a good way of determining if a Practice is good or not? Does it really matter which school or scripture they use? Are there some I should avoid?  


I ask because I generally put a great ammount of stock in tradition and linieage in general and it's something that concerns me that if I start down the path of proper practice/ritual and application I want to do so in a Tradition that is going to bear fruits or is more grounded in the ""truth"" for want of a better term.  


Sorry for the sprawling question and thank you in advance"
Buddhism,From the Bodhicharyavatara,"We need both truth together all the time to stay on the Middle Way, away from the extremes of realism, idealism/nihilism, dualism/manyness and monism oneness. 

Conventional truths or dependent origination taken alone as an absolute leads to the extreme of realism. Emptiness taken alone as an absolute leads to the extreme of nihilism. 
Thinking that everything is from a real mind only, that nothing is external, leads to the extreme of idealism / Yogacara. Etc. 

We need both method and wisdom together all the time as a path because this is in accord with the fruit, with the real non-dual nature of everything. That is the meaning of the Union of The Two Truths, non-duality, inseparability of 
appearances and emptiness, of bliss and emptiness, of the Two Truths.

Buddhism,Steve Hagen's Buddhism Plain and Simple &amp; Some Advice,"I'd like some advice from the community here on how I should proceed.

My primary knowledge of Buddhism comes from Steve Hagen's ""Buddhism Plain and Simple"", Alan Watt's ""The Way of Zen"", and Stephen Batchelor's ""Buddhism Without Beliefs"" (I know this one is a controversial one). 

But above all, it's been ""Buddhism Plain and Simple"" that has endured. I've read it 3-4 times at this point. I can't think of any thing in the book that I disagree with. But a lot of posts in this community lately have contained a lot sectarian sniping, particularly about the topic of Zen, and frankly I'm not really sure what I should do next.

My wife jokingly describes me as a Buddhist to friends, but I'm not sure what that really means in practical terms for me - I don't self-identify that way to others. But, frankly, I find myself craving (oops!) community and the company of experienced practitioners to help develop more consistent practice. 

There is a Buddhist temple within reasonable driving distance, but I can't read their website and just based on what I can understand, I'm afraid that I might feel like a cultural tourist and, worse, find something that is superstitious and petitionary and dogmatic in its own way (much like my Christian upbringing). 

So - in short - based on my interest in Steve Hagen's book, how should I go about seeking community? What 'kind' of Buddhist would I be? Is that even a meaningful question? And are these western books pretty skewed from the perspective of traditional/cultural Buddhism to begin with? I really feel like I don't know what that label means."
Buddhism,Mahakala vs. anatta,"I am always juggling intellectual understanding along side my personal practice of meditation (samatha, vipassana). I like to study religion, philosophy, and science. I am especially interested in Buddhism, and Yogic traditions, as well as neuroscience, and physics.

I always loved the images of Mahakala from Tibetan buddhist traditions, but today listending to the Sadhguru at Harvard lecture he talks about kala as time, the physical cyclical time that we all observe through the senses...as opposed to Maha kala, the great time that is non-physical. The great time of consciousness (consciousnesses itself, as distinct from waking mind, dreaming mind, or dreamless mind states).

I'm wondering if there is any commentary about the relation of the concepts of anatta, as a culmination of anicca (impermanence), karma (cause/effect), and pratityasamutpada (dependent origination)...in relation to Maha kala, as a time that is orthogonal to the physical and cyclic time.

In Buddhism is Maha kala a permanent thing (underlying karmic cycles, 'timeless'), that is like atman and incompatible with anatta? Or is Maha kala a condition that creates an environment from which the phenomenon of anatta arises?"
Buddhism,Enlightened Monks,"Hi everyone,.

I'm just in the process of starting out with practicing Buddhism. Last night my teacher explained that there some Monks who are enlightened, and during deep states of meditation are able to look back at previous lives.

Could someone provide me with anywhere I can read up about this and possibly provide any further information?.

Thanks !"
Buddhism,The Characteristic of the Not-Self,"So I am rather new to Buddhism (started learning and practicing about 6 months ago) and I was wondering if someone could help me wrap my head around this concept.
I have been reading The Tree of Enlightenment by Peter Della Santina as an introduction to the concepts and teachings of Buddhism and I became confused on how a moral obligation to this life and the next lives exist if there is not a self. I understand the concept of the not-self when it is by itself but it seems to me like it almost contradicts interdependent origination in that your karma carries on through this life and the ones to follow.
Sorry if this is a little long and if I didn’t clearly convey my question. Thank you for your time.

Edit: Thank you all very much for your responses. They have helped me get a better base to build my understanding from here on. Thank you all again."
Buddhism,"When life gets to be “too much,” what do you do to quiet an anxious mind?","I don’t know if this is the subreddit for a question like this. But I have been incorporating Buddhist practices into my everyday life and I am slowly learning about what it’s all about. I am in a very chaotic time in my life and although it is exciting, it is often too much for me to handle and I can’t function how I want to. I suffer from quite a bit of anxiety and PTSD and although I see a counselor, I am hoping for some insight as to what I should do to relax and finally gain some peace. I am open to anything and willing to learn. So what kind of meditation, breath work or other practice/tool/exercise do you use to slow down when life gets crazy?"
Buddhism,Question about Anapanasati (Samatha) for experienced/seasoned meditators.,"First of all i would like to clarify that i am not looking to cultivate insight (at the moment) so no Vipassana style answers please.

Ok, so my basic understanding of breath meditation (in a nutshell) is to relax, pay attention to the feeling the breath makes as it goes in and out (know the breath) and when a thought distracts you from this, as soon you become aware of the fact you have become distracted, dont judge or get annoyed, simply place your attention back on the breath. Rinse and repeat.

Ok my question is, where do i place my attention in the pause between the in and out breaths. Do i kind of just drift off and let the breath sort of ""wake"" me up when it starts again? or do i become aware of the pause in between breaths and wait for the next breath? If the answer is the latter then isn't that sort of, watching the breath but also watching the lack of breath/space between breaths too? then it's not really breath meditation is it? it's like watching the breath but also watching the lack of breath/space meditation too? Sorry if this is a silly question it has been bothering me for a LONG time."

Buddhism,Manual of Insight says that moral shamelessness and moral fearlessness get reduced as you progress. It states that they are overcome in the 4th Stage of Enlightenment. Can you confirm it? Do this moral shame and fear keep getting stronger after Arhatship?,"**Where did I read it**


I was reading ""Appendix 4: Uprooting Defilements"" of Manual of Insight by Mahasi Sayadaw. It's a table stating the defilements in the Stages of Enlightenment.

**I also read**

I ended up finding out that the book refers to 2 pali terms. Moral shame is **hiri**, and moral fear is **ottappa**.

So I read this article [The Guardians of the World by Bhikkhu Bodhi] (https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bps-essay_23.html).

And the short, clear and practical [Hiri and Ottappa Sutta] (https://discourse.suttacentral.net/uploads/default/894/996765295f76c8e0.pdf)."
Buddhism,On calling oneself Buddhist,"So I came across this subreddit recently, and have been going through some of the older as well as more recent threads. There are some fascinating discussions here, and much to be learnt.

However, reading some of the views expressed have left me a little confused too. I have benefitted greatly from Buddhist teachings and philosophy, and have been quite comfortable calling myself Buddhist, but I am starting to have doubts now. 

I got introduced to Buddhism through *Zen Mind Beginner's Mind* by Shinryu Suzuki, and the fascination this introduction filled me with led me to read a lot of other Buddhist works (by Goldstein, Bhante G, Analayo, Mahasi Sayadaw, etc.) 

I consider my life currently guided to a significant extent by Buddhism. I meditate for an hour everyday, try to keep the five precepts to the greatest possible extent, and make every effort to base my daily life decisions on the noble eightfold path.

**At the same time**

I have a high regard for the Pragmatic Dharma movement and its teachers, and have benefited a lot from it (This seems to be predominantly frowned upon by many traditional Buddhists)

My meditation is guided almost exclusively by *The Mind Illuminated*, which again does not seem to be a favourite in this subreddit (owing to reasons such as lineage, which frankly doesn't bother me at all.)

I cannot bring myself to accept the supernatural elements of Buddhism, such as rebirth and the realms. This is probably because I was raised Hindu, and superstitious beliefs such as these were the exact reason for my disillusionment with Hinduism. However, I see that popular opinion on this subreddit seems to be that 'Right View' necessarily entails acceptance of the whole of the Buddhadharma, including the supernatural.

Having said all that, I have full confidence in what I believe to be at the heart of the Buddha's teaching, which is that *dukkha* is real and that permanent  liberation from *dukkha* is possible through sustained and diligent practice of the eightfold path. For this reason, I don't really identify with Secular Buddhism either (which doesn't really believe Awakening is real or permanent.)

My question, then, is - what does it take to call oneself Buddhist? To be clear, I am not looking for confirmation for myself (after all, 'Buddhist' is also a label.) Rather, I am interested in what this community's views are in regards to Buddhist identity.

Thanks for reading.

Buddhism,Dilgo Khyentse on Practicing the Dharma,"Such is the strength of delusion and habitual tendencies that practicing Dharma might initially seem very hard; but these difficulties will gradually subside. Once you have understood the essential point of the teachings, you will experience no hardship or difficulty with the practice. Your efforts will bring you joy. It is like developing any skill - as you master the important points, it becomes progressively easier, you gain increasing confidence, and your capacity and endeavor keep on growing.

Whatever meditation or reflection you have done, it will never be wasted. The benefit it brings will be present in your mindstream at the time of your death, and will help you be reborn in a place where the Dharma flourishes, near an authentic spiritual teacher. Life after life, you will evolve from a mediocre into an average practitioner into an excellent one. The essence of learning is reflection, and the essence of reflection is meditation. As you go deeper into the meaning of the teachings, the wondrous qualities of the Dharma will become ever clearer, like the sun appearing ever brighter the higher you fly.

The sign that you have fully assimilated your learning of the Dharma is that you become peaceful by nature. The sign that you have assimilated your meditation is that you are free of obscuring emotions. As learning leads to reflection and reflection transforms into meditation, your eagerness for the deluded activities of this life will relax, and you will yearn for the Dharma instead.

Anything you do that is in accord with the Dharma, however small or trivial it may seem, will be beneficial. As the 'Sutra of the Wise and the Foolish' says:

Do not take lightly small good deeds,    
Believing they can hardly help;    
For drops of water one by one    
In time can fill a giant pot.

Buddhism,At a Crossroads,"Lately, i've felt as though I'm almost always stuck between two decision points. Having come across the teaching, i've been faced with the idea that it's good to withdraw, it's good to be secluded. To do away with and slowly turn away from is only a prerequisite in order to get actual, real training and progress done for your mind. But this all goes against what everyone else wants, what others want, what i want.

Because i feel like i keep holding out on others. When it's my time to do or say anything, i get scared, and i can feel my anxiety. It's like, to live a life where i overcome that IS a path in and of itself. But for me to do this, i'd have to engage in chit chat, engage with the world, and if i do that, it would be impossible for me to also live a life where i renounce everything and everyone, because that would be contradictory.

So, i don't know what to do. The part of me that wants to go past myself, and live fully, and unconditionally, goes against that other part of me, which wants to just disengage. They are like two different flavors, each with their own set of tastes. The only thing i know is that i can't keep staying undecided. I have friends that are out there, and i just keep holding back, and it's not doing anyone any favors it seems.

I had decided to give it up at one point, but although i was filled with tranquil feelings, i also felt bland inside, feeling as though many of my attachments have been severed. It could be good, i think it probably is, but i also do not know.

And after waking up from this dream of mine this morning, i realize how badly i still want to reach out and connect with others. But i'm not sure how i can. That'd be to continue to build, to fabricate. That won't help in letting go.

It's as if i always need to justify that which i'm doing, and right now, that which i'm doing, potentially, goes against all of the ideals that i've created over the past couple of years. It's always, ""But what's the point"". Right before i'm about to take that leap, ""But what's the point. This isn't the path, this isn't the way"".

Has anyone else felt this way?

I am just so lost. Perhaps, the desire to connect is simply, just another desire. Maybe i was never meant to have a life where i could connect, and build, deeply with others, as i try to do so in my dreams."

-- _Twin Peaks, Season 1, Episode 6: Cooper's Dreams_

* * * * *

Let's talk about how people are, according to the Buddha:

1. Virtually all people are profoundly, thoroughly defiled by desire, aversion, and ignorance.

2. Due to said ignorance, the vast majority aren't even aware of their defilements.

3. Virtually everything defiled people do is a direct result of their defilements. 

4. Most people fabricate a tapestry of lies and self-deceit to convince themselves and all around them that their actions are driven by noble motives rather than base defilements.

5. This tapestry of deceit is in fact a direct product of the defilements, an advanced defense framework that they employ.

The ""tapestry of deceit"" is the core of the self. Robert Wright in his latest book presents compelling evidence that the self is primarily a machine to justify our defilement-driven existence to others, in order to secure and improve our status among them and thus our survival odds. Of course, the best deceit is the one you believe yourself, so we evolved to believe in this fabrication, this self that we contrived.

Therefore by design, most people cannot see through their own self-fabrication. Specifically, they believe the excuses their self defense framework concocts to justify their greedy and hateful actions, i.e. believe their behavior is skillful (moral, noble) when generally it is not.

David Lynch, the creator of Twin Peaks, is an adept meditator and a fairly wise man. You can see it in his work, much of which is a study of delusion.

This character he created, Laura Palmer, represents a specific type of person who has gained enough Insight (Vipassanā) to see the truths listed above.

Laura can no longer deceive herself. She can clearly see her own, as well as others' defilements. In fact, she is most keenly aware of her own defilements:

&gt; She said [people are] really sick and rotten on the inside. Her, most of all.

By digging deep into her psyche and uncovering the demons of her defilements, **she has also freed them**. In Freudian terms, she had to break through her own ""tapestry of deceit"" (her ""self"" aka ""ego"" - an interwoven framework of unconscious defense mechanisms) to come into direct contact with, gain direct knowledge of her own defilements. But these defense mechanisms she blasted through - they were the seals that kept the demons largely contained (repressed). Thereafter, she had unparalleled access to, and was likewise subject to unparalleled influence by, the deepest, darkest depths of her defilements:

&gt; And every time she tried to make the world a better place, something terrible came up inside her and pulled her back down into hell, took her deeper and deeper into the blackest nightmare. Each time it got harder to go back up to the light.

You can see this behavior in people whose high level of mindfulness makes them prey to greed, addiction, aversion etc even more than the less mindful. For example, this explains how Chögyam Trungpa literally drunk himself to death. It's especially bad because this mindful drilling at the root of the self-construct **dissolves and unravels the self**, so self-preservation is no longer a compelling deterrent to self-destruction.

Self-destruction may invert to appear skillful and desirable.

This is an instance of Dark Night of the Soul (Dukkha Ñana).

That's why Laura wants to die, doesn't really care to live, and loses all sense of caution or self-preservation.

Compare in Nietzsche:

&gt; Zarathustra’s eye had perceived that a certain youth avoided him. And as he walked alone one evening over the hills surrounding the town called “The Pied Cow,” behold, there found he the youth sitting leaning against a tree, and gazing with wearied look into the valley. Zarathustra thereupon laid hold of the tree beside which the youth sat, and spake thus:
&gt; 
&gt; “If I wished to shake this tree with my hands, I should not be able to do so.
&gt; 
&gt; But the wind, which we see not, troubleth and bendeth it as it listeth. We are sorest bent and troubled by invisible hands.”
&gt; 
&gt; Thereupon the youth arose disconcerted, and said: “I hear Zarathustra, and just now was I thinking of him!” Zarathustra answered:
&gt; 
&gt; “Why art thou frightened on that account?—But it is the same with man as with the tree.
&gt; 
&gt; The more he seeketh to rise into the height and light, the more vigorously do his roots struggle earthward, downward, into the dark and deep—into the evil.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Yea, into the evil!” cried the youth. “How is it possible that thou hast discovered my soul?”

Nietzsche was also wise enough to perceive the risk that lies waiting for a person like Laura, which became her ultimate fate:

&gt; But it is not the danger of the noble man to turn a good man, but lest he should become a blusterer, a scoffer, or a destroyer.

Nietzsche explains that the noble (ariya) person who weakened the fetter of the delusion of self cannot go back to being a deluded excuse-making machine (""a good man""), but his danger is to ""become a blusterer, a scoffer, or a destroyer"":

&gt; it drove her to consciously find people's weaknesses and prey on them, tempt them, break them down... Make them do terrible, degrading things...  Laura wanted to corrupt people because that's how she felt about herself.

Laura is fact stuck at a particular phase of spiritual development. Her insight exposed to her, in painful clarity, all the defilements afflicting herself and others. However, this is the extent of her wisdom in the phase she is stuck at.

The result is enormous suffering, Dukkha Ñana. Her unsealed defilements are bubbling up from the depths, but she has no defense against them. She can see much of the disease, but none of the cure. She tries to escape to sensual oblivion - drink, drugs, sex - but she is far past the point of delusion that they are satisfactory, so they offer no relief.

In her distress, she projects her suffering onto others, using her beauty and wisdom to inflame and expose the defilements of those around her. She takes pleasure in demonstrating how those around her are slaves of their lust. This provides a sliver of relief - it assures her that she is not alone in her defilement, and others are just as bad and in fact worse than her, as well as comically unaware of their sorry state. She also perceives - correctly - that making others painfully aware of their defilements will nudge them towards spiritual progress. In fact she **acts as a teacher**, forcing those around her to confront the vast, submerged extent of their defilement. On the grander scheme, she is tearing the mask of hypocrisy off the face of Twin Peaks society as a whole.

However, she is also painfully aware that her actions are not for the most part motivated by a sincere wish to benefit anyone, but by her own defiled, unskillful state - specifically, her resentment for her own suffering, aka her _aversion_.

This ultimately manifests in annihilationism - her belief that she can and should be utterly destroyed, that her own death will bring a final end to suffering, so she knowingly flings herself over the edge. Ironically, Lynch will show us clearly that death is not the end for her.

To leave poor Laura alone for a bit - there are people like her, throughout history and also here and now.

People who enjoy tearing the mask of hypocrisy of others' faces, perhaps a bit too much.

I experienced some of this personally.

You tend to see the worst in people, and the world generally. You tend to see the world as an immoral place. Which, objectively, it generally is.

You have no compassion for people because their defilements are vividly obvious to you. The blissful veil of ignorance is pulled back and you are confronted by stark, unpleasant Truth. It's much nicer to live in the fairyland where almost everyone is driven by innate universal goodness which always prevails. This is an illusion our society works hard to instill.

In theory as a mindful person you should also be in touch with your Buddha Nature, which could inspire you to be loving and kind. However, that doesn't happen to people in Laura's state. Generally, loving-kindness is not well developed in such a person. Sometimes it seems entirely absent. Other times, it tends to flicker with intense sporadic pulses that often manifest as **a flash-flood of guilt**. I've seen that with people I encountered. They are cynical and mocking but then once in a long while they awake to a flood of condensed, defiled (poisoned) compassion - a compassion that is deeply attached and thus heavily oriented towards remorse and self-flagellation for all the suffering they've caused.

More than anything, that's the catalyst that made Laura leap to her death - negatively-charged, unskillful compassion, aka guilt.

That's why ""she tried to make the world a better place"", but ultimately failed since her defilements were ever too strong.

To sum up this long and rambling post:

The fully deluded believe they are good people and the world is a good place.

The semi-deluded see that they are bad people and the world is a bad place.

The fully enlightened project goodness, love, and kindness even in the darkest of nights.

They see clearly through the predominant defilements of people to the faint glimmer of good in them, and skillfully kindle these tiny flames.

The enlightened person is good not because the world is good, but because he is an overflowing fountainhead of goodness.

He projects love and kindness not as reflecting back gifts that were given to him, but as a clear, unobstructed channel for them to flow through him.

I can see all that in theory but personally I'm still stuck in the semi-deluded state.

Laura is inextricably involved in Twin Peaks and all its plentiful defilements. She is that one person everyone in Twin Peaks knows. Her deep immersion in everyone, and everyone's immersion in her, is symbolized by the large number of people who shared her sexually. Visually, her portrait is often presented as emblematic of all of Twin Peaks, sometimes ethereally superimposed over a view of the town and its surroundings, etching her as part of the landscape.

In fact, she is presented as a Christ-like figure. A martyred scapegoat for all of Twin Peaks' sins, a point of convergence (cathexis) of all the town's defiled energy. She's involved in every shady dealing and dirty little secret lurking behind the town's fabricated, spotless moral facade (the ""self"" mask of Twin Peaks).

To avoid similar fate, I detached myself from people completely, and strove towards dispassion. This generally worked in the sense that I largely managed to avoid hurting people at all.

Still, I am very good at seeing the worst in people and pretty bad at loving them.

I had enough insight to see the world is immoral, unloving, and unkind. In response, my attitude towards the world reflected these qualities: morally indifferent, unloving, and unkind.

To use the terms from a past post: I was being **reactive**. An enlightened person would act in a **generative** manner.

At least, I think so.

Or to rotate back to more familiar Buddhist terms: I was acting **conditionally**, while an enlightened person would act **unconditionally**.

This is frankly where I am right now. Some bits of insight, understanding of where the path is supposed to lead. Not a clear sense of how to get there.

One exercise I've been trying recently is to pull back my vantage point. Instead of focusing laser-like on people's evident defilement, I try to zoom out, see them as a whole. See how often they are trapped, somewhat helpless, suffering. They willingly pursue their defilements, which to be sure is a terrible indictment against them, yet they are also their defilements' victims. In a sense, they are first and foremost victims, and only as a result of that - aggressors.

Used in this way, insight occasionally makes me feel compassion for people rather than condemn them.

Another interesting side note of this post: consider how high the bar for full enlightenment is, and how rarely it is fulfilled, at least nowadays. A fully enlightened person would be a channel of unwavering, overflowing, selfless love, kindness, and compassion. Nothing you can do to that person would affect this flow in the least.

How many of our Buddhist teachers and leaders are remotely like that?

It seems the best we can hope for is someone like Chögyam Trungpa, a person of some insight and wisdom but still deeply, hopelessly mired in defilements.

And if you have time, watch the first two seasons of Twin Peaks. It's a good show."
Buddhism,The importance of samatha and vipassana meditation,"Hello, I have started visiting the diamond way buddhist center. Our Lama teaches us guru yoga even when we're beginners and we haven't meditated before. Do you think it's right to start with guru yoga instead of samatha and vipassana meditation?

Every Lama I know from the Internet require the strong foundations of samatha and vipassana meditation before doing any vajrayana practices. I don't know if the approach of our Lama is useful for beginners as me.

Buddhism,Do zen practitioner still follow the teaching of Buddha these days?,"From my experience some people don't even know basic teachings of Buddha and are too focused on their masters. I feel like Zen is becoming more and more separated from original teachings of Buddha.

Buddhism,Dharma without rituals,"&gt;\[Somebody asked me,\] ""I do not like prostrations and rituals. Can you teach me dharma without rituals?” I told him, go out on a date with no ritual behavior. You just sit there, you don’t talk, you don’t make eye contact, you don’t giggle, you don’t touch. Nothing. Do you think this will be a successful date? No.
I went out on my first date with my wife in New York City. You dress nicely, you smile, you talk, you gaze, you touch. This is the ritual of dating. And at the end of the night you get a kiss.

&gt;I met a Zen monk once. He explained to me that unlike Tibetan Buddhists, Zen didn’t use all that ritual. They went straight to emptiness. Then I had a meal at a Zen temple. Every single movement was a ritual. How you sat down, how you unfold your napkin, how you hold your bowls, how you put them down, where you place your chopsticks. Every single gesture. There was no room for choice. This was a ritual for gathering the mind. But the rituals and methods of devotion need to be explained; otherwise they seem to come from Mars.

Buddhism,Two Quotes To Ponder,"Browsing the internet tonight I happened upon two quotes regarding Buddhism that really turned on a bulb in my mind, so to speak. [This](https://i.imgur.com/ABwwEOh.jpg) and [this](https://i.imgur.com/3DvWyN4.jpg), specifically. Some new level of understanding *clicked* as the second one initially hit me. We are like someone sleepwalking, enwrapped within their own mind, stuck in the stories that we are spinning behind our eyes as we take each step forward. We—the *I*, the *Self*—are just relections of all that's around us. It is the story we tell ourselves. When we can see the Buddha in even that drunk homeless man that you might drive by on the street—for he too fears violence and instinctly wants love and compassion like all beings—then we can be free.

Sometimes I've seen Madhyamaka logic, nature of mind, emptiness, no-self, and ""pure vision"" used as ways to ignore or repress suffering. 

What are good ways to avoid spiritual bypassing as an individual?

What are good ways to avoid doing this as a community?

Hope for a good discussion. Thank you for your input. "

Buddhism,Buddhism as an Idealist Philosophy?,"**tl;dr: idealism is almost universally considered wrong in Western philsophy, could/would/will/can this change your mind about Buddhist philsophy?**

This is a question coming from someone who, although has an intellectual interest with Buddhism, has not (at least not so far) indulged in observance or practice of its teachings. Which means a) I apologise for any insensitivity, and b) I apologise for any ignorance or strawmanning - my knowledge is limited.

From my research on Buddhism itself, and also what other people have said vis-à-vis Buddhism being Idealist, I don't think it too controversial to say that it is. Insofar as Idealism is a term in Western Philsophy defined in either of the following 2 ways:

1/ something mental (the mind, spirit, reason, will) is the ultimate foundation of all reality, or even exhaustive of reality

2/ although the existence of something independent of the mind is conceded, everything that we can know about this mind-independent “reality” is held to be so permeated by the creative, formative, or constructive activities of the mind (of some kind or other) that all claims to knowledge must be considered, in some sense, to be a form of self-knowledge.

With the former being the metaphysical/ontological definition, the latter being the formal/epistemological definition. Source: Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philsophy.

So firstly, I should say the following questions and observations are only relevant if you do consider Buddhism to fit within either of those definition. Anyway, I ask this because in Western philosophy, idealism (both forms), is considered almost universally to be incorrect. The arguments against idealism by Bertrand Russell and GE Moore so convincing that Idealism simply isn't considered a valid philosophical position anymore (other than for historical curiosity). The PhilPapers survey found that just 4.3% of English speaking academic agreed with it. 

Given this, firstly, would you consider reading the arguments against idealism produced during the 20th century that have been considered so conclusive in the English speaking world, and if so could you envisagen them changing your mind? Or has scripture, experience, and your own reason proven to yourself so conclusively that the Buddhist philsophy is correct that you doubt you'd ever have your mind changed? "
Buddhism,A question about Michael Singer’s “The Untethered Soul”,"In the book, he talks about the boundaries that society imposes on us, which we then impose upon ourselves. He tells us that if we want to know why we do something, don’t do it for a day. For example, to understand why you do your hair or wear nice clothes, try to go to work one day without those clothes and you’ll know why - your mind will tell you. 

Taking this idea one step further, to understand why you DON’T do something, try doing it and you’ll know. Your insecurities will show. 

My question is: is this how you get to enlightenment? "
Buddhism,What is the buddhist approach to deal with self-harm?,"Hello everyone,

I suffer from a disorder called Skin Picking, which lets me crawl in my skin for minutes and hours.

This results in scarrs, shame and guilt, but also anger, sadness and disappointment.


I usually do it when I'm stressed, but sometimes just out of curiosity or boredom.


I already signed up for the subreddit that deals with that problem and even though there is some good advice, I always pick again and again, worse and worse.


It gives me the feeling of cleaning, of erasing failure from myself.

Now that I want to get more into buddhism, I wonder if there is any buddhist approach how to deal with self-harming behaviour.



I'm thankful for every help."

Buddhism,Wrong View,
Buddhism,"How do I, ""get out of my head?"""," 

""You never really relaxed. You seemed stiff the whole time. It was like you waaaay overthought everything. You need to stop thinking and start simply feeling.""

This is what my friend told me when we went to a cuddle puddle together. He is trying to get me, ""Out of my shell."" He is trying to get me to, ""Loosen Up,"" or, ""get out of my head."" So, he invited me to these various unrelated closed new age-ish non-religious groups. Some of them involved eye gazing, telling strangers your emotions, or dancing around a fire without abandon.

Writing idiomatically, I understand, ""solve for x,"" thinking. I understand algorithmic thinking. Like, when I clean a house, I have a checklist that I visualize/imagine like a heads up display in my vision. When I change lanes, I always signal, look at relevant side mirror, check behind me for blind spot, turn. When I have a conversation, I follow the FORD model for small talk. Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams. There is more to this algorithm. For manners, I follow, ""Daisy Eyebright's, ""A Manual of Etiquette on Politeness and Good Breeding."" I pay attention to the corner of peoples eyes/mouth for reading facial expressions.

Question: What the heck is this mystical/magical, ""get out of your head?"" How does someone like me practice such intuitional thinking? How do people, ""feel,"" what to do next instead of follow a pattern or a process?

I tried meditation, journaling, and these other activities, but I don't see how they do anything. When I meditate, I can turn off words/mind-pictures, and I can just listen to the sounds around me, the emotions in me. However, it doesn't help me know what to say in a conversation, or know what to do in a cuddle puddle."

Buddhism,Identity in Buddhism and identity in psychology.,"So, in Buddhism, identity view is a fetter, which is to be abandoned. And I see why, if you cling to rigid beliefs about yourself, reality is going to shatter those beliefs.

That being said, I was recently diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, and one of the hallmarks of the disorder is a weak sense of identity. Which in psychology is considered a deficit. And is something I need to heal/work on.

I'm confused. As it stands now, I try to not have rigid beliefs about myself, I try to view myself as a dynamic and changing person that sometimes manifests certain traits, and often exhibits some of them. I try not to define myself too much.

On the other hand, I feel a sort of groundlessness from this, and often feel disconnected from much of my life story, and feel very unsure about myself, since my tastes, interests and traits tend to change a lot.

Buddhism,I'm a Buddhist experiencing a very real crisis of faith,"Hi everyone. I'm looking for a little commiseration and/or advice on the situation I find myself in. I'm wondering if any of you have experienced the same.

This post is going to talk a bit about my skepticism and struggles with my experiences. I want to make it clear that I'm not looking to denigrate anybody's lineage, tradition, or practice. The very fact that I'm experiencing such struggles is because I believe these practices have value, and I find it painful that I can't connect with them as I'd like to.

Here goes:

&amp;#x200B;

I've been a practicing Buddhist for about 3 years now. I was a pretty staunch atheist who started off looking for a totally secular Dharma, and started a personal morning meditation ritual based on a ""buffet style"" approach of things I liked from the Pali canon, Thich Nhat Hanh and Chogyam Trungpa. As I got deeper into trying to understand concepts like emptiness and satipatthana, I found myself wanting to find a teacher, join a sangha, and become a more formal sort of practitioner. I got less and less attached to the concept of being anti-religion, and instead became more and more interested in the insights I was discovering by being open to the Dharma.

After a lot of trial and error with various local Buddhist centers, I felt unbelievably fortunate to find a vajrayana sangha studying under an accomplished lama. I instantly liked everyone in the sangha and really felt that something unique and beautiful was happening there. This frankly took me by surprise because I was trying to find something ""secular"" and wound up joining the most ritualized and hierarchical Buddhist community around. What can I say? It clicked.

Still, my feelings on a lot of the practices ranged from agnostic to totally disbelieving. I didn't feel connected to guru yoga, either in relation to Padmasambhava or the lama (whose teachings I loved, but who I struggled to ""view as the embodiment of all the sugatas,"" as the scriptures enjoined me to do). I couldn't visualize or connect with yidam deities. I didn't believe that Padmasambhava was born on the pistil of a lotus flower or that Prince Siddhartha took seven steps on the day he was born. I felt inspired by Shantideva's writing, but kinda glossed over the parts where he tried to scare me with depictions of the hell realms. In short, I connected *so deeply* with some elements of the Dharma and tantric practices, but there were other elements I *so deeply* didn't get. I decided to focus on strengthening my practice and let the rest sort itself out.

Well, it's now been over 2 years with this sangha and not much has changed regarding my feelings. I still love my Dharma brothers and sisters, and our lama. But I still find myself feeling like the least-committed member. I still don't know how I feel about rebirth in general, let alone a really specialized esoteric practice like phowa, so sometimes I feel like I'm just plain faking it. The people around me are ever more committed to guru yoga, pouring ever more time and money into the lama's Dharma activities, and I find myself biting my tongue so as not to offend or ""say the wrong thing"".

As my practice has become more ritualized I feel that I have become a ""church on Sunday"" type of person. Sometimes my relationship with the practices feels transactional, like (for example) I'm *using* Vajrasattva to purify my karma rather than really *living* the Dharma. Sometimes I think I was a better Buddhist when I had no idea what I was doing and I meditated by staring at the living room wall and trying (usually in vain) to successfully count 10 breaths without getting distracted. At other times, though, I *know* that the instruction I've received in generating Bodhichitta (for example) has made me a better, more skillful person, and there's probably no way to put that toothpaste back in the tube, so to speak.

For me, these conflicted emotions have been compounded by a deep desire to be more engaged in alleviating suffering in the world, and a feeling that my sangha (like most Western sanghas) does almost nothing substantial in this regard. While Christians and Jews and Muslims are feeding the homeless and sheltering at-risk refugees, my sangha is in talks to raise money to buy the lama a house. In theory, this helps us ""root Dharma in the west"" and thereby benefit all beings, but it feels increasingly ludicrous when there are beings in need of immediate help right in our city. And when it comes to discussions of current events in the Buddhist world, there's always lots of deflection and excuse-making for the sex abuse scandals at Shambhala and Rigpa, or the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, where I'd like to think that the Way of the Bodhisattva enjoins us to take a firm stand on these issues.

I essentially feel like I'm in a marriage with someone I still love but we have ""grown apart."" I could of course go try to sit at the local Zen center again, or maybe give the Quakers another go... but the truth is that the connection I made at this sangha was unique and I worry that my practice will completely wither away if I become a one-man sangha in my living room again.

Frankly, this is a very weird situation to find myself in considering how anti-religious I was just a few years ago. Most of my friends can't even wrap their heads around the idea that I go to a room full of statues to prostrate and chant, so they can't offer me any insight or advice on what I'm going through. How about you, internet? Got anything for me?

&amp;#x200B;

Buddhism,On teachers of enlightenment,"Hi all.

I know that the general (and very well intentioned) advice of this sub is to find a real teacher and a sangha for seekers on this path. However, some of us (e.g. me) are not fortunate enough to be residing in reasonable vicinity of a sangha.

I am a beginner on this path, and am having to rely only on books and online resources for studying and practicing the dharma. I am just listing below some of the teachers who seem to be popular among seekers (at least among those seekers with an Internet footprint):

-&gt; **Culadasa**: my journey pretty much began when I read his book, which is about meditation. He also has a huge number of dharma talks about the eightfold path and general topics related to enlightenment.

-&gt; **Shinzen Young** : Like Culadasa, his teachings emphasise meditation while also having his series of Dharma talks. 

-&gt; **Joseph Goldstein** : Have read his book and listened to his dharma talks, and find him to be an excellent dharma teacher, and the real deal when it comes to explaining *sati* , in sharp contrast to most watered-down versions of mindfulness.

-&gt; **Rob Burbea** : Has a an inexhaustible collection of dharma talks and covers a lot of ground in them. His book also introduced me to some very profound works in Mahayana Buddhism (Nagarjuna's), which has been very fruitful to me.

I have also read text by a lot of other Buddhist teachers (Bhikku Bodhi, Bhikku Analayo, Thanissaro Bhikku, Bhante Gunaratana etc.) but with them, I feel comfortable accepting and following their teachings without any hesitation, because they are ordained monks who literally live the dharma.

With the four teachers I have listed, I feel a bit conflicted. Their teachings I find very informative and practical, but I am not able to help having a feeling of slight hesitation with them. They are not ordained, for one thing. Secondly,for teaching Buddhist insights/awakening, shouldn't the teachers themselves be enlightened? Some of them even charge for sessions with their students (which is understandable in a way, yet a little off-putting.)

What is this sub's views on modern teachers  such as these of Buddhist enlightenment.

**PS**: I mean no disrespect to any of these teachers. I am just trying to seek some views that would hopefully help get my confusions clarified."

Buddhism,What is your approach towards modern age ''hedonism''?," Well to be honest, hedonism was always a thing, but i feel like in the recent decades things have gone more extreme. I was born in 1989 and as back as i can remember i was bombarded by various pleasures coming mainly from entertainment.

To make the case. As we speak every aspect of possible sensual pleasure has a huge industry to back it up. Do you like visual stimulation&gt;movie and trip industry, auditory&gt;music industry, savory&gt;food, sexual&gt;pornography and sex toy, olfactory (i mean smells)&gt; perfume, alternative sensual stimulation&gt; drugs, participation in alternative ''worlds''&gt; games. And the list goes on to be honest.

I would say that people who are into hedonism (a lot) have some of these traits in common:

1. They seem to focus on their preferences and become obsessed with them.
2. They tend to grow intolerances to conditions that come in contrast with their obsessions.
3. They tend to develop kind of self-destructive behaviors. It mainly has to do with apathy towards things that they don't care about. Some neglect human interactions, others neglect their bodies, others neglect environment, society, other people well being.
4. Some develop narcissistic behavior. To a greater extent, they will take advantage of other people to promote their well being. To a lesser extent, they will push away people who have different lifestyles and never hear from them again.

Anyway i can tell a lot more things about this subject, but i think i have covered up the basics. What is your opinion on it and how do you approach it?"

Buddhism,"If the Buddha had been born in Texas in 1950, would the dharma still teach about 10 realms, divas, and rebirth?","The question is impossible to answer. But it's another way to frame the question: ""How much of the Buddha's teaching is a product of the time and culture of his upbringing?""

Sorry about making yet another thread like this. I've read a lot of threads similar to this one, but I haven't found a satisfying answer.

There is this saying that if all of humanity was wiped out for a billion years and another intelligent species took our place, the Christian Bible in its entirety would be lost forever. There is no way to independently derive the ten commandments or the Genesis origin story without the cultural and historical context in which they were written. However, most science books would look the same.

I believe the Four Noble Truths, even the Eightfold Path or the Middle Way could be independently derived. Maybe they would be framed differently, but the core of the teachings would be the same. That is why they are so amazing.

It's no surprise to me that many people rarely question the fallibility of the Buddha. Many of his teachings seem like pure genius to me, and the lifetime works of other contemplative geniuses have only supported, not repudiated, his message. But there is some pretty weird stuff going on at the periphery of this religion. I have this dissonance in my mind because I wonder why such a brilliant set of teachings about suffering and karma feels the need to make claims about whether there is a realm of gods or not. Or whether stream-entry gaurantees enlightenment in 7 rebirths.

Sometimes it feels like I'm reading the Lord of the Rings or something. How can the Buddha claim to know this stuff? But he was right about so many other huge things.

Any thoughts or advice appreciated."

Buddhism,I'm struggling to fully commit to buddhism.,"After researching religion over the past few years I've found my beliefs really align with that of buddhism. I have watched countless videos and read countless pieces by the Dalai Lama, and am currently reading ""How To See Yourself As You Really Are"".

I've tried a couple of times to really commit to buddhism, but in short order I find myself overwhelmed yet again by the weight of the world and unnecessary burdens it brings. I feel like this could be due to my relatively surface level knowledge, and not having the slightest clue where to start.

If anyone has any tips for keeping myself accountable, or if anyone would be willing to take me under their wing and mentor me and teach me, I would greatly appreciate it. 

I've been feeling very lost lately and have fallen victim to the pull of worldly things again which is what made me ask this. I want to be free of these vices.

Thank you everyone."
Buddhism,Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche on changing the world,"Trying to change the world without changing our mind is like trying to clean the dirty face we see in the mirror by scrubbing the glass. However vigorously we clean it, our reflection will not improve. Only by washing our own face and combing our own unkempt hair can we alter the image. Similarly, if we want to help create conditions that foster peace and well-being in the world, we first need to reflect these qualities ourselves.

Buddhism,How to accept my girlfriend's past?,"I love my partner.  She is beautiful,  ferocious, intelligent.

She is also currently on a 10-day retreat.   So it's been really valuable time for me to reflect on our relationship. 

I often become really insecure, internally, when thinking about the number and quality (her ex was a really cool guy) of guys she has been with. 

I know this is MY problem and not hers.  I dont trust her at times (she has cheated- on her previous ex with me. Disclaimer - but so have i).

This pervasive insecurity can block me at times.  I lash out.  Distance myself.

I've sourced a few things for me, and I work on themdaily.  But this feeling comes back.  And I so truly want to be with her.


Extra:
Can anyone speak to an experience after such a long retreat? What it was like coming home?  I'm not sure how to recieve her, other than just listening and loving.

Thanks in advance."
Buddhism,Summary of the Dhamma,
Buddhism,My understanding of practicing Buddhism,"I'm wondering if I have the right idea when it comes to understanding what Buddhism does for me and if there's anything I'm missing or need to add.

By increasing one's awareness of one's thoughts and the things that go through one's mind, one can better identify where the cravings that lead to one's suffering come from. Then it's important for the practitioner to value certain actions, activities, or interactions with people that alleviate those cravings and sustain a sense of meaning in one's life. 

I was just looking up how a main criticism of Buddhism is that it's nihilistic but after finding a recent post on a video of Thich Nhat Hanh explaining that people aren't necessarily empty but ""empty of something,"" I understood that to mean that nihilists, for example, could be empty of values and meaning in life. However, as a Buddhist, it's important to take that emptiness of values and fill it with the values which encourage the actions and activities of a more fulfilling life and which don't allow the cravings that lead to one's suffering to arise.

Buddhism,Could insights and attainments be from developing more right-brain neural pathways?,"This question is inspired from a book I read called, My Stroke of Insight. A brain researcher suffered a stroke and suffered damage to her left hemisphere. She lost all sensation of separateness, where her limbs ended, etc. Her description sounds a lot like descriptions I have read from Buddhists. 

We know that if you practice brain activities, corresponding neurons will be used, and improve, and grow, like a muscle. Through meditation, one can be practicing using their right brain in new ways, allowing new ways of perceiving. If you can leave behind the left-brain's rigid perception of boundaries and polarities, your perception could be vastly changed. 

This need not diminish the truth of Buddhist practice, but could explain how we achieve better perception in a more concrete/scientific way. "
Buddhism,What I've Learned,"Just wanted to create a post, really highlighting a key aspect that i've learned and how it applies to me and myself right now.

I'm pretty much trying to quit playing this video game. I know that there's nothing inherently bad about it, that for us to make such value judgments on our everyday experiences can certainly pose to be a problem, but it is still a cause of much stress, and i notice that my mind settles and feels content when im actually NOT playing, then when i am. The Buddha was right, sensual pleasures are like a leper with sores, as they try to constantly scratch those itches, but in a healthy state of mind, they actually serve to be painful to one's being. 

So it's day 1, and i've got many more to go. I'm not going to count, just trying to take it one day at a time, and i know that the key to all of this is that even though i have this intense desire to actually play, i can be fine just *sitting with it*. It doesn't mean that i have to say, NO i absolutely must not play, or YES I WILL PLAY. It's ok if the feeling is simply there, and that it arises and ceases. That is fine, there is nothing i have to say or do, and in time, this craving will ease away slowly.

So just wanted to share that all with you. I don't think i would have ever had the right mindset, or understood how to properly deal with these sorts of situations, if it wasn't for these couple of years really trying to engage, understand, and practice the teachings.

Metta to you all \^\^"

Buddhism,"If attachment leads to suffering, why are some people inclined to be in a relationship with an S.O./partner/spouse?","Edit: Thank you for your responses! I can't possibly reply to each of them, as I have quite a busy schedule. But I do upvote the ones I have read and agreed! Even if I don't reply to your comment, I always read each of them. I also upvote if I agree fully without room for debate.  


First of all, I decided to ask Buddhists because I want to know from Buddhists's point of view regarding this post. I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post this. (Please do tell me if it is.)

On relationship-related subreddits, I always find people having problems with their S.O., even so far as breaking up. What intrigues me is that other redditors keep saying, ""You'll find the right person for you someday."" Or the variations.

Why not say: ""This is a life lesson and experience for you. You are now free from the clutches of the toxic wrong person in your life. Use this opportunity to heal yourself by doing single-person activities, hanging out with family or friends, etc."" Why not say that instead?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the more people keep saying, ""You'll find the right person for you someday."" the more I feel that those words lose value and responsibility over time. I mean, it totally depends on person A's social environment and interaction exposure to how many people there are in his life, in order for person A to be able to find his true S.O.. What if person A has an extremely busy job which drastically limits his free time to socialize with people outside of work-related conversations? This is just one example I thought up of the many possible cases in life.

&amp;#x200B;

Having experienced bad relationships in the past, now I find my lone self peaceful, not having to live up to anyone's standards or drain my energy in working on a false committed relationship. Rather than being committed to the wrong S.O. to whom I must give my attention (talk with, care for, etc.) every day but will some day break up, I would prefer having friends with no strings attached, who I can care and being cared for on psychological level.

This does not mean I'm anti-relationship. I just don't want to waste anymore of my life time building a relationship with immature manchildren, neither do I want to feel anguish if I do break up with the wrong S.O.. If I happen to find a true mature gentlemen in my life, then I would gladly commit to a relationship with him. But alas, the number of manchildren far exceeds the number of true mature gentlemen on the Earth, that it's becoming harder to find them."
Buddhism,Help me detach from social media addiction,"As the title states, plan and simple I’m addicted to social media. It’s honestly a filler for my life. If I feel I have nothing else to do, I turn to it. When in reality I know I can be reading an informative book (I have plenty) or even meditating. 

I started exercising again, and even then I find myself scrolling on the stair machine. I’ve always wondered about walking meditation and how to meditate in an aware, conscious state while going about my daily activities. 

Anyway, I can’t help but feel left out without social media. I don’t know why, that’s why I’m afraid to part with some apps for good. I go through this vicious cycle of deleting, re downloading, deleting, re downloading. And when I scroll it, it’s for hours on end.

I don't want to give it to just anyone since I'm afraid she'll be used as a fighting dog or as one of those dogs that people here send to ranches to fend for themselves (I live in a very primitive country) If I can't find her a good home from I'll have to put her down, I was going to do it today but I just couldn't move forward, I started throwing up from the pain and stress that it was causing me to kill this amazingly loving dog. 

Now I don't know if I'm being selfish, or if I should let the dog live regardless of the quality of life that it will have. 

I wish I could ask her. But yeah, I don't think i'll be getting a reply. 

What do I do??? Do I put her down if I don't find a good warm and loving home, or do I let her live and give her away knowing that her existence might be a painful one. "

Buddhism,disturbing thoughts &amp; memories of traumatic experiences,"every once in a while a memory will pop in my head of something very scary or upsetting that’s happened to me. for example, when i was a teen my mother accidentally caused one of our cats to pass away. when these memories show up, which is only occasional, my body feels so crazy. hot, tingly, like i’m going to pass out. it’s not that i think what happened is bad or a problem, but it is extremely disturbing and sad. and it’s not really a problem that my body goes through this, but i am wondering...is it because i haven’t fully processed the trauma? sometimes i let myself follow the thoughts just a little, to expose myself to that crazy crazy body feeling of terror and extreme sadness because i don’t want to immediately push them away out of fear. however i don’t need to be reliving these traumas, it seems unnecessary. plus we always sort of convolute or taint our memories, often without realizing it, and i want to be careful not to do that when these thoughts and feelings come. 

in the end it’s not a big deal, because they are just thoughts and feelings. but i’m wondering if semi-immobilizing memories of things like a sudden loss of something important to me, or seeing my mom upset in deep grief and guilt, are popping up because i need to learn from them, or if i need to let go of them and not try to conceptualize about why they happen. 

any thoughts, buddhist &amp; “nondual” friends? "
Buddhism,I have an odd question. How would you personally deal with a phobia of bugs?,"I feel like I’m in a constant state of unease or even fear in my own home. There are two dead roaches on the floor I need to throw away, but the thought of getting near them disturbs and upsets me.

I can’t call a pest control service yet because I have a mild hoarding problem. I don’t collect items, I just have a hard time throwing out things, including trash. I know it’s disgusting. Ironically, the bug phobia makes me want to avoid touching any trash, boxes, or dark places. Ironic because throwing out trash makes them less likely to appear. I refuse to live this way anymore. I managed to clean my living room. I just need to clean my bathroom and bedroom now. Easier said than done with this phobia.

If anyone has any insight on a different way to think about things I’d be grateful. I’m mentally exhausted."

Buddhism,"About ""Good Thoughts. Good Words. Good Actions.""","Did the Zoroastrians come up with this quote first, or did the Buddhists come up with this quote first? I've heard this at my Buddhist study group before, but I've also seen this on the movie ""Bohemian Rhapsody.""

Buddhism,Can we know what the Buddha said?,"Like Jesus, or Socrates, the Buddha left behind no writings. Coming from a Christian upbringing, I know that the last Gospel, the Gospel of John, was written about 70 years after the death of Christ. In that time, the story of Jesus had apparently mutated into one of a divine being descending to Earth to save humanity - pretty far from what historical scholars think early Christians actually believed, let alone Jesus himself. So if a moderately long period of time was between the Buddha's death and the first comprehensive account of his teachings, wouldn't it be reasonable to assume his message encountered some pretty profound distortions? Does it matter to you? "
Buddhism,Question about attachment to my clothes,"A relative of mine from a different city wanted me to let her borrow one of my shirts, so that she could figure out what my exact size was. I gave her one of the button up shirts I wear frequently (like once a week, or once every couple of weeks) from my suitcase, as a reference for what fits me perfectly, because she insisted on sending me some traditional clothes only available in her city. 

My shirt isn’t anything extravagant or spectacular, but it has been through a lot of major events in my life with me (college, graduation, ups and downs of life) over the last three years, and has become naturally altered over time and many washes to my own body.

To my surprise, I received a picture message from a different cousin who was wearing my shirt, and I was surprised at the intense emotional reaction that I had to that.

I’m usually a very giving person, and I often try to go out of my way to give to others whatever they want or need. I’m not someone that grips on to material possessions so tightly, but for this instant for some reason when I saw that photo of him wearing it, I felt a sudden stab in my solar plexus area.

It felt as though I had been infringed upon, and I was taken aback at how visceral my reaction was at something that normally wouldn’t be a big deal to me. I know that my “me”ness permeates it, and I don’t know why it felt slightly like losing a limb or an old friend. I’ve already decided that it won’t be right for me to ask for it back, and in my mind I relinquished my ownership over it.

I love the cousin of mine who was wearing my shirt, and I would send him a hundred such shirts if he asked, without any hesitation. 
I just feel like maybe there is some lesson here I need to understand about attachment and letting go, and why I reacted the way I did.

Can anyone give me your perspective or insight on why I had the reaction I had?
When I don’t feel attachment towards most material things, why did I feel as though I had been slapped, by something so trivial?

How can I relinquish even my ownership over things that are so personal to me?"
Buddhism,What are the best reliable sources to learn about Buddha?,"**Short version:**

I am looking for the most reliable sources to learn about the guy and what he taught.

**Long version:**

I have been told a tonne of lies about this guy and his teachings throughout my life. Some of the lies made him look terrible and some made him look awesome. However, I've heard enough about him to want to know more. The problem I have is with the generic issues one faces while trying to learn about ANY religious figure. I fully realise that I may at best get second-third-hand reports of what he said and did. I am still very much interested in reading materials on the subject which aren't biased towards selling me any particular sectarian view of the guy. Are there good books that can give me that kind of an insight into his life and opinions?

Buddhism,Nothing Lasts,"&gt;Now, if we think carefully, we will see that everything we have ever done is gone and will not come back; it is nothing more than a memory, an image in our mind like last night's dream. Even what manifests today is like tonight's dream, and all that we will do tomorrow is like tomorrow night's dream. Nothing lasts. Yet we still become obsessed with these pointless appearances, whiling away our time as we act out our passion and aggression; quarrel, flatter and insult; hoard and accumulate material things; experience pleasure and pain; and indulge our prejudices. We end up with nothing but a mass of shortcomings! By their very nature, all worldly appearances are seductive illusions. What a loss that we believed them to be permanent, stable and unchanging. ""I won't concern myself with what happens from here on out,"" we should think sincerely to ourselves. ""Instead, I will look at the problems that clinging to a self creates!""

Buddhism,"buddhist teachings on dealing with conflict, pain, addiction","Hey everyone, I have a question regarding Buddhist thoughts/teachings on situations of conflict. This question arises due to a personal situation: someone close to me (in my family) has been dealing with problems of addiction for several years. This is clearly a problem to those of us around him, yet it is not so severe that he is unable to work, live, etc. (what you would call a functioning addiction, I guess). This is (I believe) at the root of a lot of my pain and anger towards him, and I have found over the past three years especially that I am going through a constant cycle of resentment and anger, pain and hurting, and utter frustration. I have attempted to describe these feelings and my desires for him to make changes many times, and nothing has happened. Sometimes when he asks me to do things, gets angry at me, or takes any other random actions, I suddenly feel so incredibly overcome with emotions of anger and pain -and especially resentment- towards him for the fact that he has made me feel this way for so long. Yet, at the same time, I love him so much and live every day in fear that something will happen to him- I'll get angry, but then immediately feel regretful because I fear that I'll lose him and never forgive myself. I've been reading a lot on Buddhist teachings for addiction and have been trying to translate those ideas toward how I -as a family member- should act. In terms of the direct conflict situations, to what degree should I explain my pain and frustration to him? To what degree should I merely accept the situation and say that he is an addict who has not recognized his addiction, and all I can do is love him and enjoy the times I have when he's sober, and forgive him for his actions when he's not? I feel as though I'm stuck in a cycle and it is really negatively affecting my mental health and my ability to live. The teachings I've read recently have provided me great clarity, but I still feel as though I don't have a clear answer. I would appreciate any advice on this situation. I know it's complicated and there is no right answer, but if anyone has experience with this, or is knowledgeable on Buddhist teachings on conflict and addiction, I would appreciate advice or guidance. Thank you in advance!"

Buddhism,🌷The Last Lesson on Impermanence🌷,"~The actual event of how Kyabje Getse Rinpoche entered Parinirvana. 

《This text is to quell the rumor on Rinpoche's decease is due to a car accident)》

On 18th Nov (10th of tenth month of Tibetan calendar), Rinpoche was making preparation to leave the mountain the next day and planned to stay a night in Adzom Monastery and Kathok Bairoling Monastery. On that evening, Rinpoche half jokingly chatted with his two attendant lamas - Lama Konphel and Lama Guru about impermanence, and so he said:""If I were to die tomorrow, it might be difficult for both of you to prepare the wood, I think you better buy some oil, cremate me on the mountain over there."" He instructed them clearly on how the funeral should be prepared. 

Then on the 19th Nov (11th of tenth month of Tibetan calendar) approximately 10.30am, as wished by Rinpoche himself, attendant lama Konphel accompany Rinpoche to take a stroll towards Azdom Monastery. Suddenly, Rinpoche walked towards a road with dangerous condition, the lama immediately tried to stop him by shouting :""Rinpoche don't go there, there's no road over there!""  Rinpoche responded by chiding him :""You still have very strong attachment on this physical body!"" And kept walking by himself, he very soon fell down and showed parinirvana. That was around 11.30am.

The account above is based on the joint statement in Tibetan version and collected audio recording.

11月18日（藏曆十月十日）那天，由於隔天要下山，於是法王稍作準備，並法王計畫在從蓮師聖地揚列雪關房到首都加德滿都的途中，於噶陀安宗寺和噶陀毘廬林寺分別住宿。當天傍晚，法王對著兩位隨侍弟子：空培喇嘛(Lama Konphel)和古如喇嘛(Lama Guru)兩人以半開完笑的口吻談論人生無常之際，說道：「我明天死掉的話，你們兩個要取得木柴可能不容易，我看你們就買些油，在山上那頭把我火化掉吧。」如此這般，清楚地交代了後事。

11月19日（藏曆十月十一日）上午約十點半，按照法王的意思，隨侍的空培喇嘛陪同法王步行前往安宗寺。突然，法王步往路況不佳的地方，隨侍喇嘛馬上勸阻：「仁波切，不要去那邊，那邊沒有路啊！」結果反遭法王斥責說：「你對肉體的貪著還真是深啊！」於是，法王逕自前行，在該處跌倒後，便示現了圓寂。時約上午十一點半左右。

以上根據寺院聯合發布的藏文聲明，以及相關錄音資料整理而成。

Buddhism,Sensual Pleasures,
Buddhism,New to Buddhism - Questions about breaking Precepts.,"A bit of background: I am not  Buddhist (*yet)* but I am a huge believer of causing no harm and being the best person I can be, and Buddhism is increasingly making a lot of sense to me. I am looking into it on an on-going basis.

My current question is about the Precepts. I have broken the majority of them at some stage to varying degrees. I have definitely caused people pain in the past, and have been a horrible person. I have apologised where possible, but I can't take those actions back, and there are some situations where reconciliation can't occur.

Aside from the occasional alcoholic drink, I don't break them now (and haven't really broken them for years) but I still feel horrible about the times I have broken them in the past. I keep asking myself whether I would be a fake or dishonest Buddhist because of these past events. 

I have definitely grown as a person in recent years, and I have realised a lot of my previous actions have been influenced  to some extent by a long period of trauma (I have PTSD, depression, anxiety, have suffered agoraphobia etc). For example, gossiping as a way to feel socially accepted, being socially inappropriate, pushing people away, drinking heavily and causing other people grief/harm. Again, these aren't things that happen now (or not that I am aware or), but I feel so much remorse, shame, and worry about them that I don't really know where to go from here. 

I would value input from experienced people, and/or others who have had similar concerns! 

Many thanks."
Buddhism,How does Shikantaza facilitate Enlightenment,"Hi,  


What are the mechanics of Shikantaza? I see the Tibetan traditions often use a very analytical approach to Emptiness of phenomena and self. They will identify the object of negation (the 'I') and then ultimately refute its existence. Then rest the mind in that experience of not self.   


How then does 'Just Sitting' offer such an experience?  


If it doesn't, what is the relationship between the Buddha and his teaching on ending suffering and Shikantaza?  


Thanks in advance!

Buddhism,"Amitābha's Sukhāvatī &amp; the ""Lotus Vault World""","What is the relation of sukhāvatī to the 蓮華藏莊嚴世界海 (the lotus's vault, the perfected lokadhātu, the ocean) attested to in the Buddhāvataṃsakanāmamahāyānasūtra T279 &amp; Saddharmapuṇḍarīkanāmamahāyānasūtra T262, wherein arahantaḥ, according to the Mahāyāna as attested to in aforementioned scriptures, perfect Buddhahood?

Buddhism,dealing with ego attachment to salary,"Hey all,

I've been dealing with an inner issue this week. I am a new grad in tech. I have worked very hard over the past few years. I went from making no money to making well over 6 figures with a snap of the fingers.

&amp;#x200B;

Since this big change I have felt a big internal change too. I have noticed that I have started to attach my sense of self worth to salary(which I recognize is complete bullshit-we're all just human). I don't understand why this has happened as my sense of self worth has always been healthy and internal. I don't like the change.

&amp;#x200B;

Have any of you experienced something similar? How have you gotten through this? I want to get back to my more grounded self, but have been having a difficult time letting go of this attachment(granted its only been a week), and find myself hoping I can tell people(and then thinking, ""seriously man?"").

Buddhism,Avatamsaka Sutra on Bodhisattva Householders,"From the Cleary translation, pp 548-549. ""Enlightening beings"" is his translation for *Bodhisattva*.

___

When great enlightening beings live at home with spouses and children, they never for a moment give up the determination for enlightenment; with correct mindfulness they meditate on the realm of all knowledge, liberating themselves and others, enabling them to reach the ultimate. Using appropriate means they transform the members of their own households, causing them to enter the knowledge of enlightening beings and causing them to develop to maturity and attain liberation. Though they live together, their minds have no attachments. By their basic great great compassion they remain in home life, and because of their kindness they harmonize with their spouses and children, with no hindrance to the pure Way of enlightening beings.

Though great enlightening beings be in the home life and work at various occupations, they never for a moment give up the will for omniscience; that is, whether they are dressing, eating, taking medicine, washing, looking around, walking, standing still, sitting, reclining, speaking, thinking, asleep or awake, whatever they are doing their minds always dedicate it to the path of omniscience. They concentrate and contemplate unremittingly, because they want to aid all sentient beings and settle them in enlightenment; with immeasurable great vows they embody countless great roots of goodness, diligently cultivating virtues to save everyone. They forever divorce arrogance and indulgence and proceed surely toward the state of omniscience, never conceiving any intention of turning to another path. Always contemplating the enlightenment of all Buddhas, they forever abandon all impure ways. Cultivating practice of what all enlightening beings learn, they encounter no obstruction on the path of omniscience and stand in the ground of knowledge. They are devoted to recitation and learning, and collect roots of goodness by means of immeasurable knowledge. Their minds have no affection for any mundane realm, nor are they obsessed with what they practice. They wholeheartedly accept and hold the principles of the Buddhas' teachings. Thus enlightening beings living at home cultivate and internalize roots of goodness in every way, cause them to grow, and dedicate them to the unsurpassed enlightenment, which is the essence of the Buddhas.

At such a time, enlightening beings, even when they are feeding domestic animals, all make this vow: 'I should cause these creatures to leave the realm of animality, to be helped and comforted and ultimately be liberated, having forever crossed over the ocean of suffering, eternally annihilating painful sensations, forever removing suffering physical and mental elements, eternally cutting off painful feeling, accumulation of pain, painful actions, the causes of pain, the root of suffering, and painful situations. May these sentient beings all be able to leave these behind.' Thus do enlightening beings focus their thoughts on all sentient beings; with their roots of goodness in the forefront, they dedicate them to knowledge of ways of liberation for all beings..."
Buddhism,is it better to do what you desire (and realise desire doesnt serve you) or never do what you desire and stay curious your whole life,
Buddhism,The most important aspect of practice for laypeople,"I think the most important aspect of practice for laypeople concerned with spiritual achievement, as well as *anyone* concerned with doing *anything* with their lives, is **consistency.**

A few years ago I delved pretty heavy into Buddhist practice and found it very useful in doing the things that I wanted. For a few months I spent a lot of time practicing metta and mindfulness meditation, but eventually things started to spur out of control and lead to me dropping out of the path almost completely. I'm making this post to advise those who may be experiencing something similar in their practice, or who *have* experienced something similar. 

Despite being established in a metta practice, I noticed that I was still experiencing a lot of malicious thoughts and feelings related to my circumstances at the time. I panicked and tried desperately to get rid of those feelings, which lead to accomplishing nothing. I got tired of the struggle and gave up on metta meditation altogether.

So my advice to those reading is to be aware that you will still have those malicious thoughts and feelings and that it's okay to have them. We have often been practicing maliciousness for the majority of our lives, so it's no mistake that they won't be let go of so easily. The most important thing in regards to those malicious thoughts and feelings is that you let them come and go like any other thought or feeling. 

Let yourself experience whatever you experience while doing the things you care about. The important part of a metta practice is practicing the metta, not whether you feel or think certain things. Trying to control whether you experience those things will send you spiraling down an infinite hole of miserably trying and failing at controlling things out of your control.

So what is the alternative? When establishing a metta practice, there's no need to be concerned with whether you're the most saintly person alive or that you experience no negative emotions, but that you have a way that you can do it every day. Think about other practices in your life and how you got to be good at those things. If you're good at video games, you probably played them every day. You weren't concerned with bursting with effort into becoming a professional player, you just played it every day. If you're good at metta, it's probably because you put effort into it every day versus trying to be a Mother Theresa in a few weeks. 

It can be especially confusing because with things like metta it can be easy to fall into the trap of ""trying to get rid of the opposite."" When we think about the skills we have regarding the things we enjoy, we probably didn't pursue them while being afraid that we'll be a bad video game player or a bad student or a bad tennis player. 

So when adopting a metta practice, the most important thing is to find a way to do it every day that feels effortless. If that means you practice for 5 minutes a day, then great. I'm probably going to be doing the same thing. Eventually that 5 minutes will turn into 10 minutes. You'll get better and better at it. It'll take root in your being. 

When we're pursuing metta, we can look at it as growing an apple true. At the start, it's just important that we water the sapling frequently. It doesn't matter whether it's bearing fruit or not, that comes later. So start watering the saplings of kindness today and with time you'll have some beautiful, tasty fruit!"
Buddhism,What book would you recommend to get one started on learning about Buddhism?,
Buddhism,Finally found a Sangha!,"I've identified as buddhist for about 4 years now, and growing up in a family who hates everyone who isn't like they are, made it very hard to find a community and place to go to learn from someone. I felt like I wasn't learning much from just reading on the internet. I decided to go to college in a pretty diverse town and was disappointed to find that there was a club for every major religion and even a few minor ones but a Buddhist club was nowhere in sight, and the closest temple was one I couldn't walk or take a bus to. I was recently talking ro a friend about religion and they asked where the closest temple was. To my surprise I found out that someone has opened a small place for us in their home thats a 30 minute walk from campus!

TL; DR: After ~4 years of feeling lost and alone in my journey, I've finally found somewhere to go and get guidance in my journey."

Buddhism,Any coders/programmers who are able to meditate or practice mindfulness while in the process of coding?,"I very much enjoy coding, and it is my ideal career choice, but a great concern for me currently is that I lose mindfulness of the body when coding. 

While in the process of coding and debugging I will get lost in the work, only to realise later I had lost all mindfulness, with poor posture, restlessness and an agitated mind at the end of a session.

This is a significant concern for me, as I'm not sure if it actually is possible to be mindful while engaged in such a task. I'm curious to know if any software developers/programmers here are capable of doing so, and if your work hinders your practice in any way?

If you can, I would greatly appreciate some advice on how to maintain awareness while involved in such a task :)"
Buddhism,Wanting to learn and start,"I have spent so much of my life in chaos, confusion and restlessness. I want to learn how to be calm and peaceful and feel like Buddhism would teach me that. I have no idea where to start and have very little understanding of it all. There is a temple 5 mins from my house should I go and seek advice? Should I read certain books? 

At this stage in my life I feel like I need peace and calm. I have no idea how to achieve it but feel this is the right step to start"
Buddhism,"Does Buddhism explicitly state that the ""goal"" of existence is to end suffering, or rather just lay a roadmap for those who recognize the existence of suffering and wish to see its cessation?","A friend and I were having an interesting discussion. He was saying that he appreciates the tools that Buddhism has given him, but is not sure he agrees with the goal of Buddhism (to end all suffering). I realized that I had never thought about it that way, where Buddhism has a goal, or is prescribing a purpose to existence. I always just thought it was kind of a guide for those who wish to see the end of suffering.

Does Buddhism explicitly make a disctinction between these two, or is it somewhat implied that to recognize that suffering exists and can have an end would motivate one to pursue that end?"
Buddhism,Candrakīrti vs Vimalākṣa,"Venerables Candrakīrti &amp; Vimalākṣa both wrote commentaries on the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā (MMK). This is a passage from the 18th chapter of the MMK:

&gt;諸佛或說我 或說於無我 諸法實相中 無我無非我 諸法實相者 心行言語斷 無生亦無滅 寂滅如涅槃 一切實非實 亦實亦非實 非實非非實 是名諸佛法  
&gt;  
&gt;All Buddhas either speak of self or speak of no self. All dharmas’ true aspect, within this, there is neither self nor no self. All dharmas’ true aspect is defined as mental activity’s and spoken language’s ending.There is no arising and no cessation, there is calm extinction, such is nirvāṇa. All is real, all is unreal, all is both real and unreal, all is neither real nor unreal: this is called all Buddhas’ dharma.

(Āryanāgārjunasya Mūlamadhyamakakārikāyām Ātmaparīkṣā T1564.23c16)

How do you compare these two commentaries? How do you find them similar? How do you find them different? Do you agree with one but not the other? Both? Neither? How do *you* interpret the source text?

This is Ven Candrakīrti's:

&gt;To quote: “Whatever is most familiar to one is most effective for him naturally. If one is bewildered how can one receive the truth? As it is not possible to make a foreigner understand by a language not his own, so the unenlightened person (loka) cannot be made to comprehend except by means of the everyday.”  
&gt;  
&gt;As the illustrious one said: “The unenlightened person is at variance with me; I am not at variance with the unenlightened person. What is accepted by the unenlightened is accepted by me; what is not accepted by the unenlightened is not accepted by me.” Thus the scripture. The illustrious one always treated the elements of personal existence, the senses and their objects, and the types of consciousness as “real” (tathyam). These are thought to be real when perceived by those who are to be guided - those suffering from the optical defect of primal ignorance — in whom has been aroused the desire to learn about the various natures of the things generally accepted as real. And this with an eye on the higher truth and with a view to arousing the faith of the ordinary man in himself.  
&gt;  
&gt;“This holy man is aware of every last happening in the world, he is omniscient and all-seeing; he possesses the knowledge of the inanimate world from the infinity of space to the coursing of the winds and he knows the uttermost limits of the world of beings; he knows incontrovertibly the many kinds of origin, existence and end, what is cause, what is effect, what is pleasurable, what is painful.”  
&gt;  
&gt;So, after those who are to be guided have realized the omniscience of the illustrious one, at a later time it is explained that everything is not real (na tathyam) as naively taken. At this point what is real is what does not change. But all compounded things change in fact because they perish by the moment. Therefore, because of this fact of change, they are not real either. The word ""or""; means ""and""; it is to be taken as joining the two views. That is: ""Everything in this world can be taken as real and as not real.""  
&gt;  
&gt;For some it is explained that everything in the world is both real and not real at the same time. For the unenlightened everything in the world is real; for those who have started on the way everything is false because not perceived in its naive reality (evam anupalambha).  
&gt;  
&gt;There are those however who, from long practice, see things the way they really are, who have eradicated the obstructions (avarana) virtually completely like the roots of a tree; for them it is explained that everything in the world is neither real nor not real. In order to remove what remains of the obstructions, both alternatives are rejected even as one rejects predicates like black and white for the son of a barren woman.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is the teaching of the illustrious Buddhas. It leads men from byways and establishes them on the right way. In the interests of gradual instruction and of adapting to those who are to be led, the teaching is flexible.  
&gt;  
&gt;All the teachings of the illustrious Buddhas, who are possessed of universal compassion, ultimate insight and practical wisdom, are intended to be a means of penetrating (avatara) to the eternal way of things (tattvamrta). The perfectly realized ones have not uttered one word which was not in fact a means of penetrating to the eternal way of things. They administer medicine suited to the illness. They have the urge to succour those who need guidance and they teach the truth accordingly. To quote from the Four Hundred Verses: “Things are real, things are not real, things are both real and not real: all this is said variously. Indeed all cures as such are cures for a specific desire.”  
&gt;  
&gt;But, you ask, what is the nature of “the way things really are” which the teachings of the revered ones are intended to penetrate to? This is explained in the verse “When the object of thought is no more, there is nothing for language to refer to.” When this obtains what further questions can there be? Though this is so, none the less the way things are really must be spoken of. This is done by speaking in a second sense (samaropatah). One accepts the everyday (laukika) terms “real”, “not real” and so on which are drawn from the world of transactional discourse (vyavaharasatya).  
&gt;  
&gt;Nagarjuna expresses it this way.

(Mūlamadhyamakavṛttiprasannapadā, Darbhaga 1960, Buddhist Sanskrit Texts, 10: *tatra - yadyadyasya priyaṃ pūrvaṃ tattattasya samācaret na hi pratihataḥ pātraṃ saddharmasya kathaṃcana iti tathā ca bhagavatoktam - loko mayā sārdhaṃ vivadati nāhaṃ lokena sārdhaṃ vivadāmi yalloke’sti saṃmatam, tanmamāpyasti saṃmatam yalloke nāsti saṃmatam, mamāpi tannāsti saṃmatam* \[etc.\], translation Mervyn Sprung)

&amp;#x200B;

And this is Ven Vimalākṣa's:

&gt;Some people teach that there is a soul, in which case it must be of two kinds. Either the five skandhas are themselves the soul, or the soul exists apart from the five skandhas.  
&gt;  
&gt;If the five skandhas are the soul, then the soul will have the characteristics of arising and ceasing. Thus it says in the verse ‘if the soul is the five skandhas it will have the characteristics of arising and ceasing’, and why? Becuase once arisen, it will perish. Because they have the characteristics of arising and ceasing, the five skandhas have no permanence, and just as the five skandhas have no permanence, the two dharmas of arising and ceasing likewise have no permanence. Why is this? Because arising and ceasing also perish after they have arisen and hence are impermanent. If the soul were the five skandhas, then, since the five skandhas are impermanent, the soul would also be impermanent and would have the characteristics of arising and ceasing, but this is not correct.  
&gt;  
&gt;If the soul existed apart from the five skandhas, the soul would not have the characteristics of the five skandhas. As it says in the verse: ‘if the soul is different from the five skandhas, then it will not have the characteristics of the five skandhas’. Yet no other dharma exists apart from the five skandhas. If there were any such dharma apart from the five skandhas, by virtue of what characteristics, or what dharmas, would it exist? If you say that the soul is like empty space, separate from the five skandhas yet existent, this is also wrong, and why? We have already refuted empty space in the chapter on refuting the six elements. No dhama called ‘empty space’ exists.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you assert that a soul exists because belief in it exists, this is not correct, and why? Belief is of four kinds; the first is belief in a manifest thing, the second is belief in something known through this manifest thing as when seeing smoke, we know that there is a fire. The third is belief by analogy as when, in a country with no copper, one uses the example of it being like gold. The fourth is belief in what is taught by saints and sages, as when they say that there are hells, heavens and uttarakuru. Without seeing anything, we believe the words of the holy men and thus know about them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Such a ‘soul’ cannot be found amongst these beliefs. It is not found in belief in manifest things, nor in inferential belief, and why? Inferential knowledge means that having previously seen something, you thenceforth know (about) this kind of thing, as for example a man who has previously seen that where there is fire there is smoke, subsequently, seeing only smoke, knows that there is fire. The concept of ‘soul’ is not like this, for who could first have seen the soul in the combination of the five skandhas, such that afterwards, seeing the five skandhas, he knows that there is a soul?  
&gt;  
&gt;Suppose you say that there are three kinds of inferential knowledge, the first being ‘like the original’, the second being ‘like the remainder’, the third ‘seeing together’. ‘Like the original’ means previously having seen that fire has smoke, seeing smoke now, you know that it is like the original which had fire. ‘Like the remainder’ means, for example, that when one grain of rice is cooked, you know that the remaining ones are all cooked. ‘Seeing together’ means, for example, that when you see with your eyes a person going from hereto another place, you also see his going. The sun is like this. It emerges from the east and goes to the west. Although you do not see it going, because a man has the characteristic of going, you know that the sun also has going. In the same way suffering, pleasure, hate, desire, and insight, etc. must also have whatever goes with them. For example, seeing subjects you know that they must rely on some king. But these are all incorrect, and why?  
&gt;  
&gt;In belief through the characteristic of together-ness, having first seen a person combined with a dharma of ‘going’ who reaches some other place, when you subsequently see the sun reach another place you know that there is the dharma of ‘going’. But there is no prior seeing of the five skandhas combined with a soul, such that subsequently seeing the five skandhas you know that there is a soul. Therefore, no existence of a soul can be established by inferential knowledge of ‘together-ness’.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is no soul to be found within the teachings of the saints either, and why? In the teaching of the saints, what they first see with their eyes, they subsequently expound. And since the saints teach other things which can be believed, we should know that when they speak of the hells, etc., these can be believed in, but it is not so with the soul, for there is no-one who, having previously seen a soul, subsequently speaks of it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Therefore, you may seek for a soul within all beliefs such as these four types of belief, but you will not be able to find it. Since you cannot find a soul even though you seek for it, no distinct soul exists separate from the five skandhas.  
&gt;  
&gt;Further, because of the refutation of seeing, seer and seen in the chapter refuting the six sense faculties, the soul is to be refuted in the same way. For if even an eye seeing coarse dharmas cannot be found, how much less can we find a soul by empty delusions, imagination and so forth? For these reasons, we know that there is no self.  
&gt;  
&gt;‘Mine’ exists because ‘I’ exists. If there is no I, then there is no mine. Through putting into practice the holy eight-fold path and extinguishing the causes of I and mine, one attains the firm insight of no I and no mine.  
&gt;  
&gt;Question: Even though non-self is the truth, what is wrong with teaching, merely as a convention, that there is a self?  
&gt;  
&gt;Reply: Non-self exists by virtue of the negation of the dharma of self. No fixed self can be found, so how could there be non-self? If there were a fixed non-self, then annihilation of if would give rise to attachment and craving. As it says in the Prajñāpāramitā, if a bodhisattva has a self, he cannot act, and if he has no self, he cannot act.  
&gt;  
&gt;Question: If it teaches neither self nor non-self, neither emptiness nor non-emptiness, what does the Buddha-dharma teach?  
&gt;  
&gt;Reply: The Buddha teaches the true character of all dharmas, and within that true character there is no path for verbal expressions, for it extinguishes all mental activity. Mind arises because of the characteristic of grasping, exists because of the rewards and retribution of karma in a previous world, and cannot therefore see the true character of dharmas. The Buddha teaches the cessation of mental activities.  
&gt;  
&gt;Question: Even though an unenlightened person’s mind cannot see the reality, surely a saint’s mind can see the reality? Why does he teach the cessation of all mental activities?  
&gt;  
&gt;Reply: The true character of dharmas is nirvana, and cessation means nirvana. It is in order to point towards nirvana, that cessation is also termed cessation. If one’s mind were real, what use would be such ways to liberation as emptiness, etc? Why, amongst all the samadhis would the samadhi of cessation be regarded as the highest, and why ultimately reach nirvana without residue?  
&gt;  
&gt;Therefore we should know that all mental activities are empty deceptions, and as empty deceptions, should cease. The true character of all dharmas surpasses all dharmas of mental phenomena, has no arising and no ceasing, and has the characteristic of calming and extinction solely.  
&gt;  
&gt;Question: In the sutras it says that all dharmas, having from the beginning the characteristic of calm extinction are themselves nirvana. Why do you say that they are like nirvana?  
&gt;  
&gt;Reply: Those who are attached to dharmas classify dharmas into two kinds, some being worldly, some being of nirvana. They say that the nirvana dharmas are calm and extinct, but do not say that the worldly dharmas are calm and extinct. In this treatise it is taught that all dharmas are empty in nature and have the characteristic of calm extinction. Since those who are attached to dharmas do not understand this, nirvana is used as an example. Just as with your assertion that the characteristic of nirvana is emptiness, with no characteristics, calm extinction, and no vain thoughts, so it is with all worldly dharmas.  
&gt;  
&gt;Question: If the Buddhas do not teach self, non-self, and the cessation of all mental activities and the cutting-off of ways of verbal expression, how do they make people understand the real character of dharmas?  
&gt;  
&gt;Reply: All the Buddhas have unlimited powers of skilful means, and dharmas have no fixed characteristics. In order to save all living beings, they may teach that everything is real, or they may teach that everything is unreal, or that everything is both real and unreal or that everything is neither unreal nor not unreal. If you search for a real nature of dharmas, you will find that they all enter into the ultimate meaning and become equal, with identical characteristics, which is to say no characteristics, just like streams of different colour and different tastes entering into a great ocean of one colour and one taste, which is to say no taste. At the time when one has not yet penetrated into the true character of dharmas, each one can be contemplated separately as unreal, existing merely by the combinations of conditions. There are three levels of living beings; superior, average and inferior. The superior person sees that the characteristic of dharmas is that they are neither real nor unreal. The average person sees the characteristics of dharmas as either all real, or all unreal. The inferior man, since his powers of perception are limited, sees the characteristics of dharmas as a little real, and a little unreal, regarding nirvana, because it is an inactive dharma and does not perish as real, and regarding samsara, because it is an active dharma, empty and false, as unreal. Neither unreal nor not unreal is taught in order to negate ‘both real and unreal’.

Buddhism,Understanding Transmission,"Hello, first time poster here. A bit about myself first, as it might help understand the context I come from. I'm currently irreligious/agnostic, and I've been reading a lot of Buddhism, and I do find it quite interesting and many aspects of the lifestyle resonate well within me. I've been practicing mindfulness meditation for a while now (guided via the Headspace app, though I'm slowly outgrowing it) and I actually practice the shakuhachi flute, which was used by the komuso monks of Fuke sect of Buddhism, which is an offshoot of the Rinzai school of Zen, for meditation/enlightenment. My playing of this is strictly musical in nature, even though I'm learning various honkyoku pieces of the komuso monks.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, in my exploration to understand Buddhism a bit better, I've been reading a lot, and I fell on this post about [What is the difference between Zen and Secular Buddhism?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/6d2px6/what_is_the_difference_between_zen_and_secular/) on this subreddit. It was quite an interesting read, but something stood out to me, and I've been trying to understand a bit more, specifically this statement:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I think direct transmission is important. Having teachers that have received their authorization from within the continuous lineage of the Buddha.  

  
This was in regards to Secular Buddhism not having a direct transmission from the Dharma (to my understanding). I'm trying to understand as to why this is so important. I ironically know the idea through the shakuhachi, as my teacher/master has a direct link, even here in French Canada, to Kinko Kurosawa who was the founder of the Kinko school. So I understand the idea behind the transmission, just not the reasoning as to why it's important. The komuso monks didn't have a teacher to teach them the flute, they came to that conclusion on their own. The Buddha didn't have a teacher, but still came to the deep insights he had, through practice (I imagine?) and his past experiences. Engineering school for me was the same (ish), teachers weren't really there to teach so it was mostly me reading the raw equations/ideas and through practice and past experiences, to come to an ""enlightened"" conclusion of the equations/ideas. Maybe it's a false comparison, as one deals with the physical world and the other the spiritual.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless, why is it important to have this direct transmission, and why would it invalidate the folks from Secular Buddhism? What makes Secular Buddhism less valid in that regards than other branches? I hope I'm not overstepping my bounds here with this question, I'm just trying to understand and not cause any dissent/fights."

Buddhism,Lay Arahant - Dhamma Wiki,
Buddhism,Searching for a better understanding - ascending to and from a lotus flower pedal of light,"Okay... I swear to god I am not crazy, silly at times but not crazy. I've had a hand full of crazy experiences in my life but I am only really now beginning to look out their for others who have experienced this or know what it is.

**Meat of the experience:**  I went to bed one night, vibrating. I laid down and and felt a consistent vibration from my toes to my hair. I've experienced it a hundred times before, it comes and it goes. So when things like this occur I try to explain them away.

So I asked my wife if she felt any shaking or vibrating as she prepared for bed and laid right next to me. She said ""no"".  I laid in bed a little over an hour vibrating, I got up to checkout the washing machine, check the water pumps(yard sprinkler pips run below the first floor flooring), made sure there wasn't anything I could find to give me any justification the whole house was shaking. I even placed a glass of water next to the bed and watched it to see if any sense of vibrations where coming through... *nothing*... Having experienced this before and not freaking out, just finding it really interesting that I could feel this vibration for over an hour, so I just went bed.

I woke up in the morning, in and out of  very typical morning mental fog. I walked to the bathroom sat down to pee, (the wall is thin and our 6 month old was sleeping in the crib against the same wall, so we tread lightly to make sure he stays a sleep and yes that includes sitting down to pee in the morning). I sat down... boom... I was some where else.

I felt different, peaceful, energized. I felt like my skin didn't have a barrier to it. Everything was extremely bright. I began what felt like sitting back. As I looked around I realized I was 1 of, I believe eight, flower pedals in what looked like and kind of felt like a lotus flower made of light. As the pedals began to open, each pedal began to separate from the center stem, my feet where the base of the pedal of light, my hands felt like they were in my lap/beside me and my head was the top of the pedal. As I started pulling away from the stem, my self and others where transforming/morphing from pedals of light into a human forms of light. As each pedal/person separated from the stem each one was at a different distances and morphing at different rates. As all of the lotus pedals of light separated from the stem, what felt like a silent wave of communication seemed to turn into english words. Some how it was a mix of this ""waves of communication"" and words that wrapped up a conversation, a kind of broken mix between the 2. I was the first to leave.

I remember waving to everyone saying, "" I would love to stay but I really have to get back... It's time now"", and I remember seeing my hand was made of light as I waved, still morphing more and more into a human figure. We all were departing in different directions.

I recall seeing a large open area, I don't recall seeing the ground or what we would consider the sky. But, I do recall seeing several other flowers opening/blooming in the same manner as ours. As pedals of people started to fly off in various directions.

Then... SNAP.. I was back on the toilet. I sat there going, ""OH MY GOD, what was that? was that real... (long pause to let it sink in mentally)"".  Then as I was mentally recovering I realized that I could see yellow waves of what what felt and looked liked energy flowing in all directions, the same way you can see waves coming from various directions in a wave pool. Every light wave felt like you could feel it without feeling it, if that makes any sense. But the light was moving and internally felt like waves of wind going back and forth, never moving in a backward direction. The waves didn't move forward and then backwards, there were just so many going in each direction but it was energy(no idea how I know it was, it's just that's how I felt it. I had a deep feeling inside, I believed, understood and knew exactly what it was). As I sat there, I realized I had the ability to focus and unfocus my vision to either see less energy waves or more waves. This ability to see these waves probably lasted 2 to 3 days before I weirdly forgot out to unfocus my my eyes to see energy on that level.

  
***Just ranting and sharing now...*** simply because I can and I've never actually done that in a public forum/form. I've only told a few people I know because I know how crazy all of it sounds.

  
From time to time, I find my self vibrating, sensing things and even feeling as though I could will the world to take the next few steps in the direction I want it to go for my own benefit. I've never been trained to meditate but I tend to feel like I somehow know how and sometimes I feel like I've never mediated in my life.   


I feel like there is something else out there in this world but I have no idea what. I've had experiences where I've seen energy/ghost/spirits flying around the room(never in full figure only in a blurs of light or shadows), both negative and positive. I've woken up levitating above my bed with an insane sense of comfort following the experience. I've had weirdly vivid dreams of fighting Indian spirits who morphed into wolves, all because I made a mistake and dishonored nature, which I desperately regret. Also, I  had the ability to morph into a wolf in these vivid dreams. I've had vivid dreams of entering the spirit world and escorting a dark spirit out of my own home by the back of their neck and forewarning them if they return I will return to the this realm and personally protect the people in my home. In this same time frame my 2 dogs use to stare at the corner of the room and bark at a blank wall occasionally following (with their eyes) things going across the room and into another room, which my girlfriend and I could both feel the energy of when it did happen. The random barking stopped after I visited the other plane and removed the spirit. I grew up for what had to have been 12+ years with an insanely deep deep feeling my entire point of being on this planet, alive was to inspire a single person who will change the world. One day out of no where the feeling left me and I felt a sense of accomplishment. I felt I was left to do what ever I wanted because I fulfilled my duties. and now I am just exploring the world trying to live a good life and enjoy things with the hopes to still inspire many when my opportunity arises."

Buddhism,Does meditation bring extreme happiness?,"My uncle has been practicing Yoga and studying Buddhism for 40 years, and also teaches classes. He started in the 1970’s, after almost committing suicide due to loosing both of his parents (his mother died and his father killed himself shortly after), and is now the most happy, awe filled person I, or anyone who knows him has ever met. He and I had a deep discussion about meditation last Sunday, and he said that if you take it very seriously and practice every single day for three to five years, something happens. I asked him what happens, and he wouldn’t get too into it, but said that even if he does something as mundane as going outside to throw out the garbage, it feels like he has not been outside in 20 years. He would see a leaf or a stick on the floor, and it’s beauty sends unimaginable feelings of euphoria rushing through him.

I've never been motivated to do shit, I blew off highschool because I didn't care, and now even 12 years later I'm blowing off college because I just can't get myself to give a shit. So either I'll fail and go back to working shit jobs till I remember a desire to be free from that misery, and then I'm good for a while, and then I'm back to not giving a shit, and then I do shit....then I don't....yada yada, I've went in this circle my whole life. You could tell me my family's future depends on it, you could give me critical information that would greatly impact my life, still can't care. I just have no life in me to do anything. I'm a fucking slob of a person, I only do what I have to do when it's unbearable not to. Discipline makes me miserable, sure feeling on top of shit feels good for a minute, then I can't give a shit, I just can't. I've studied philosophy, psychology, all kinds of stuff, no reasoning can put a dent in my issue. I'm tired of only being driven to do stuff when I'm at my most miserable, and I'm tired of the cycle.

Buddhism,Making sense out of mistakes?,"I felt angry (ego reaction to hurt). How could I be such an idiot?

The ego wants to make sense out of everything. Make everything that you do meaningful, leading to a higher purpose, or something. Pleasure. Benefit. Whatever. 

Then what happens is that I wait 30 mins for a specific bus on a cold windy day instead of taking other buses and walking short distance,or even just walking would've took me 15. Why did I do it? No idea.
Many people would shrug this off, but it really hurts me. 

An event like this completely ruins my framework, beliefs. 'everything that I do is meaningful'. I never waste time. My time is categorized, mostly of activities that provide future benefit. 

This, waiting for a bus, is the most meaningless activity I did in the last 2 months. Of course, when I say 'meaningless' I mean no strategic intent, no benefit (this is key). 

So my ego tries to keep my framework by saying : Ok this had meaning, I can pull one from it. Lesson learned?

For most mistakes you can learn something. Hungover? Never again. Etc.

But for this? I'll never wait a bus again? I'm bound to make mistakes of this type many many more times..

The only thing I see as 'useful' is practicing letting go in such a situation. I saw my mind at work 'What a fucking idiot I could've already been there practicing languages! I just stood here, wasn't even present, wasn't even pleasant, utterly meaningless. 

But then, I'd never write this unless it happened. Which might mean that that one event was casually more fruitful for my spiritual progress than sitting. Should I then replicate these kinds of situations??! No fucking idea! 

This bothers me :) advice appreciated. May you be well!

Buddhism,Spiritual Confusion after Mom's Death,"Hi all,

My mother recently passed away at the age of 63. She had health problems for years, so we knew it was coming soon. 

I am 26 years old, and I witnessed my mother dead in the shower, and cried over her corpse alongside my father.

I have been Buddhist for over 5 years (thanks to my mom who gave me some Buddhist reading during a difficult time) and she was Christian her whole life.

Since then my mind has been racing. I can accept her death and grieve as it comes up, but I am raci ng with thoughts about life, possible afterlife, the point of life, and how true could Christianity be. 

I suppose I am just asking for advice or similar experiences. Given my age, this event is taking a unique toll on my mind. It's like my whole ""identity"" has been thrown about and raising a million questions. 

Busdhism talks a lot about death, but I have found myself missing my mom more because of the teachings. What should I know about this?

I understand that it is an attachment to something, and I think that my attachment in this situation may be that I want people to like me and to appreciate the effort that I put towards loving and helping them. 

Is there a meditation or a mantra or a sutra or something to help let go of the attachment to what others think of me, and possibly explore more of my reaction when people don’t like me? I want to understand what is being triggered in me. Is it a feeling or fear of inferiority? 

I do practice metta, but somehow that doesn’t seem to quite fit here. (But maybe someone can explain why more metta may help?) I feel like I do have compassion towards others but I feel great pain if I think that others are not compassionate toward me. Does this make sense to anyone? "
Buddhism,Thinking to observe the mind - thoughts to analyse thoughts? Is this acceptable?,"Hi,

I've recently been trying to start a meditation practice. I've started with mindfulness of the breath - the idea being I want to develop concentration enough to stay with the breath for a reasonable period of time without distraction (10 - 15 minutes) and then move onto observing thoughts. I've been meditating for 20 minutes each sitting for around a month now - single sittings for a week, and two sittings a day for the last 3 weeks.

Questions are:

1. When you observe your thoughts, is it skillful to make comments such as - ""I think this"", or ""I desire x when I feel y"", or is it more useful perhaps to observe without making any commentary at all - or at the very least, attempting to just observe the commentary, without purposefully adding to it. I feel as though my learning process is strongly tied to my ability to put things into words. So if one feels on the cusp of realising something - should they put it into thoughts and words in the mind, and then just return ? Or simply observe the feeling of being on the cusp of realisation and feeling they ""need"" to think?

2. There are some thoughts that come and go (melodies, observations of the day) - but then there is a feeling of a sort of ""central"" voice. This one feels much more personal than the others - like my own voice. And I feel almost as if it ""blocks"" my awareness of my breath - like, I can feel my breath, but so much of my attention feels directed toward this block, which occasionally gives out thoughts - and I can't quite dislodge it. It almost feels like I'm actually not focusing on my breath at all and most of my focus is on this block - it makes my meditations feel quite shallow, I don't get very deep into it.

Anyone who could help me with this - I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you very much :)"

Buddhism,Aro gTér Vajrayana Lineage Celebrates 25th Anniversary of SNCD Buddhist Charity,
Buddhism,What is your favorite technique for maintaining peace of mind?,"Mine is ""elimination of judgments"":

One should always keep in mind that events are interconnected through the operation of physical cause and effect. Thus, apparently negative events can precipitate positive events, and apparently positive events can precipitate negative events. Moreover, the connections between events can be very indirect and impossible to predict. Consequently, if one were able to go back in time and modify or eliminate a particular event, one’s entire life might change as a result, and whether it would change for the better or the worse would not be knowable.

Therefore, one will generally never know whether an apparently negative event is truly negative in the overall context of one’s life, or whether an apparently positive event is truly positive in the overall context of one’s life.  As a result, one should eliminate judgments with respect to whether any event is truly positive or negative. Such elimination of judgments strongly promotes equanimity and peace of mind—before, during and after one’s experiences.

Unfortunately, *ekagata* has traditionally been rendered as *ekaggatā*, where the addition of a second *g* forms the word *agga*, meaning “point” or “promontory,” and *tā* becomes a suffix meaning “-ness.” Consequently, this key term has been widely misunderstood as “single-pointedness” and is assumed to refer to the practice of exclusive attention.

I live in a small place where there are no meditation teachers, and I'm in need for some answers. I have meditated for three years, and learned techniques for apps and books, but they don't answer all my questions. Are there any experienced meditators than can help me here? I'm asking this here because I have the impression that there are more experts here than in /meditation.

1. Is meditation without experiensing jhanas useless? I was quite confident with my practice until I learned about jhanas some months ago, and now I struggle with my practice because I think too much about wanting to excel and achive the jhanas. Some people claim it's pivotal to experience the jhanas, and that meditation without it is useless. True or false?
2. I meditate for 23 minutes everyday. and have done so for three years. Is it a sign that I do something wrong when I have never experienced any jhanas? 
3. I still cant focus for more than around four full breath without any distrcations. Some as above: Is it a sign that I do something wrong when it has been three years? Are there some other focus point I should try?
4. Some days the mind is more active than the day before, and the technique that worked yesterday don't do it for me today, e.g. regular breath counting. Is it okay to try different techniques during the same session? So that if not the usual breath counting does it, i then try focusing on just the out breath, and if that dosn't do it, I try counting backwards, etc., or should I stick with one technique and just accept that the mind is crazy this session even though I can't focus at all?

If it's important to know, I practice mindfulnes meditation. My motivation is to connect better with the pople around be, and to have the ability to be more present in the moment. "

Buddhism,Making peace with death,"I became intersted in meditation around 4 years ago back when I was in high school. I considered myself affiliated with a religion back then. I was a super secular person, I never prayed or attended any kinds of prayers or ceremonies. I started meditation expecting it would make me realize things that i was never aware of.

For a couple years I was meditating on and off. I would meditate for a week straight 10 minutes each day, and I would never meditate again for months. I was being distracted and I somewhat forgot I used to meditate.

Meditation (being alone with my mind) made me question the existence of a higher being. I was asking questions like ""What is the purpose of my life?"" or ""What is the purpose of ""life"" in general?"" This led me to researching and eventually becaming an atheist.

A couple years ago I became interested in meditation again, I used a guided meditation app for days or even months. I meditated once a week for a year or so, then it happened.

One night when I was laying down in my bed the realization of the inevitiblity of death and how one day i will cease to exist hit me like a brick. It caused a panic attack. 

This happened around once a month or so since. But I am not here to ask medical help, I am here to ask a more important question. 

People who had issues with death, fear of death; what different ways of thinking helped you? Which path did you follow? How did you make peace with death?

Thank you, hopefully i am not alone..."
Buddhism,Do Buddhists tend to be older?,"I'm 26 and have been dabbling in Buddhism and various sanghas for about 5 years now. One of the things I've noticed is that the sanghas I go to tend to be filled with older people. I went to this Zen sangha on and off for several years and I was the only one there that was under 50. 

I live in South Florida, so there are a lot of retirees. I'm not sure whether my experience with this is because of my location, or because Buddhist sanghas in general tend to be older (which would make sense, since older people tend to be more religious). Have people in other places notice that their sanghas are older?

I had hoped that I could use a sangha, not just to strengthen my practice but also form social connections with like-minded people, so this has been kind of disappointing. I don't mean to be judgemental towards these people, but I'm just not super stoked about hanging out with people my parent's age all day long."

Buddhism,I went to a Buddhist service today,"First off, I live in the US, California, if that makes a difference. 

It wasn't what I was expecting. The temple looked more like a church, with pews lines up on the floors and hymn/sutra books in the back of them. Instead of Christian iconography, there was a Japanese style room where an altar or pulpit would be, with a whole bunch of golden decorative stuff everywhere. This place even had a kind of Sunday School for kids, it was basically mimicing a Christian church as much as it can. I wonder if other religions do this? I assume that this was done ages ago to whitewash themselves after the Japanese internment in WWII, but I haven't cofirmed this.

The service started with a gong ringing several times, and a VERY short meditation while sitting in the pews. We then read the Three Sacred Vows aloud in an old form of Japanese that I don't understand despite speaking modern Japanese at an intermediate level.

We then sang a hymn, which sounded like a Christian hymn, but the lyrics were about Buddhism. There was even someone playing an electronic organ!

The Rinban/Reverend then gave a talk about the recent fires, the shootings at Tree of Life, and Thousand Oaks. He then brought up some Japanese Buddhist historical figures I'm not familiar with, and the troubles they faced. He then tied it together basically saying that, hardships are nothing new to humanity.

We then sang another hymn and performed Oshaku. I think I might have done it incorrectly."

The last weeks I have been meditating on death, 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the evening. Im repeating the mantra ""I may die today"" 108 times and then I focus on the breath the remaining session. The only thoughts I allow are those regarding death... but when I meditate I don't really believe that I'm going to die.. I understand it rationally and intellectually, but I can not truly believe it.. even though I almost died twice. (former drug addict) I also had several psychedelic trips where I faced death, accepted death and I let go.  

Is it the attachment barrier? The protection of self? My obsessive self-concern? Fear of letting go? 

Has anyone here experience in meditation on death? Is it anyone here that truly,  honestly and deeply understand that today might be your last day? How did you come to this realization? 

I would truly appreciate your input, because I see this as my greatest barrier too live a life in aspiration and gratitude.

Buddhism,Confidence in the Dharma,"A thing I've been struggling with. Not that I lack confidence in the Buddha's teachings for real. If I'm honest with myself, Buddhism is the only way through life that has ever made sense to me, even when my still-forming teenage brain first discovered it and could only grasp the most superficial and basic concepts (""Whoa. You mean, if I want a thing, then it's going to suck if I don't get it? Or, if I lose it once I do get it it's going to suck even more? Especially if I lose it by dying? Duuuuude."") I think in some unalterable sense I am a Buddhist dyed in the wool and will always be.

But I waver. Lately I waver like a sine wave modulates its amplitude. The wavering is part of myself as defined. This is especially uncomfortable because I'm not wavering over, say, secular humanism, or scientific realism, or some other acceptable model of the universe. I'm wavering over the Western Esoteric tradition. Let me explain.

I don't believe in magic in the vulgar and superstitious sense of the word. I don't believe that casting spells will cause curses on people you don't like or that you can talk to entities that exist on some plane of reality that is invisible to ours. I'm not convinced the latter is completely absurd but neither do I feel comfortable accepting it as real without significant evidence to that effect. I do, however, believe that rituals and spells can affect our lives by dropping ""commands"" (to use a computer programming metaphor) into our subconscious minds which cause those commands to be actualized in the space of our minds that exist beyond our conscious control. I think ritual and the technology of magic (like sigils) are a means of doing this. I have no doubt that it is all perfectly congruent with the world of physics, but I think it impossible to deny that we can operate on our minds in that way.

Incidentally, I feel that this is not alien to the Buddhist understanding of mind and the self. The tantric traditions of Buddhism seems to touch on all of this in ways that are more profound than anyone else ever has. I do however feel that it introduces an element of personal corruption into the work of realization. We are bringing about our desires. Not a bad thing in and of itself, but I think it does lead to some profound and unbuddhist outcomes. We fall into the delusion that fulfilling our desires can make us happy, for one thing. For another, we're mucking around with stuff that by definition we don't understand very well. The short and miserable lives of so many people who get involved with this stuff is a perfect example. Did Aleister Crowley strike anyone as being fulfilled and happy? Did AO Spare enjoy living, as his contemporaries described it, ""like a swine?"" Was John Balance's magical practice worth the drug and alcohol abuse that would ultimately kill him? I see these lives and I think that it probably wasn't worth it.

And yet I still waver. Why? Because it's interesting! Because I am drawn toward hidden and ill-understood technologies and knowledge. Because I enjoy the mythological stories of the West, including the Gnostics, the Neoplatonists, the Greek mystery religions, and especially Egypt. That stuff strikes a deep and dark chord within me that I can't ignore or set aside. Also, I'm fascinated by power. I'm not going to justify or apologize for that, though I do recognize that power isn't the key to happiness. But it just is what it is.

These things tug at me. They take me away from what I know is the true path I must traverse. I am not exactly asking for sympathy or an answer. That will all happen in its own time, hopefully without too much suffering. I'm just hoping that I'm coherent. What do you think?"
Buddhism,Do we pray to Buddha like Christians do Jesus,I’m sorry I’m new to being a Buddhist and I got a lot of questions 
Buddhism,How I interpret anatta (not-self),"I have been getting in Buddhism again lately and here is how I interpret anatta:

The Buddha said that the self we have does not exist but this does not mean that there is no self at all. It is called ""not-self"". ""Not-self"" is not equated to ""no-self"" because no-self assumes the premise that there is no self to identify with. Whereas, ""not-self"" can leave the possibility that a true self can exist. The Buddha indeed does not negate the possibility of a true-self. * **Yet he does not say if such exists either.** The illusion of the self does not mean the existence of a true self or the lack of a hidden self.

There are some websites like this one (Link: https://essenceofbuddhism.wordpress.com/2014/03/27/how-to-understand-the-5-skandhas-in-buddhism/) that implies that there is a true self, something where ""who you really are"", but the Buddha never mentioned the existence of such a thing.

Where did the idea of a True Self actually comes from? Is there places where the Buddha does mention of a True Self?

Buddhism,Eating mindfully on my first retreat,"Today I went on my first ""mini-retreat"" on Vipassana meditation. It was really great to hear about Buddhism from our teacher and have someone speaking to us directly.

What I also found extremely interesting is how much we can apply mindfulness in our daily lives, not only when we sit down to meditate. I wrote down some notes while reflecting on our ""mindful eating"" session during lunch break:

Whenever you are about to put some food into your mouth, look at what's there in your spoon, on your fork, in your hands. Remind yourself about the long way this piece of food took to be here for you.

Thank the plants that grew for you.

Thank the animals that lived for you.

Thank the rain that fell for you.

Thank the sunlight that shone for you.

Thank the ground that provided nutrients for you.

Thank all the people, past and present, that made this possible for you.

It is totally mindblowing for me to realize how much beauty there is even in the most mundane things. We just need to remind ourselves every now and then.

Buddhism,What is Buddhism's conception of a person?,"I've been learning about Buddhism and started thinking about one of its assertions: the fact that souls do not exist.

I looked up the definition of a soul so that I can understand what this truly means, and I saw that a soul is the immaterial, non-physical aspect of a person.

That means that a person's thoughts, values, sense of humor, etc. are all part of his soul.

Now, if people don't have souls, or in other words, there is no non-physical part of a person, then that logically means a person only consists of the physical.

As I understand, the illusion of self or of having a soul is created by attachment to non-permanent things, and ceases once you achieve Nirvana.

So, what is a person really, in Buddhist thought? To me, they seem more like... things, as opposed to human beings. Things that walk around as if they have a blindfold on and mistakenly thinking the idea of themselves exists in reality as they crave different types of things and suffering because of it all the while. Then if they achieve enlightenment, they realize who they thought they were was just an illusion, which means what they are is simply a physical body, right?"

Buddhism,A question about an interpretation of karma and reincarnation,"So yesterday I was reading on Wikipedia about karma and reincarnation in Buddhism because these are the only things that don't fully resonate with me.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_in_Buddhism

And I read that:

&gt; In early Buddhism no explicit theory of rebirth and karma is worked out (...)
&gt;
&gt; In early Buddhism, rebirth is ascribed to craving or ignorance.
&gt;
&gt; In later Buddhism, the basic ideas is that intentional actions,[44] driven by kleshas (""disturbing emotions""),[web 3] cetanā (""volition""),[21] or taṇhā (""thirst"", ""craving"")[45] create impressions,[web 4][note 8] tendencies[web 4] or ""seeds"" in the mind. These impressions, or ""seeds"", will ripen into a future result or fruition.

I'm not sure if I'm interpreting this right. Would this mean that unvirtuous behaviour, like following a craving or treating someone with animosity, leaves imprints on the mind that lead us to repeat those behaviour more often, thus rebirth would mean the new state of the mind that is more or less prone to those behaviour, and when you achieve nirvana you're free from rebirth because you let go of your self, and are permanently virtuous?

With this the part of karma and rebirth make perfect sense to me, because it's like a metaphor that can be used to explain this mechanism to non-buddhist and convince them to behave virtuously.

------

And another thing that I read was https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta#Anatta_and_moral_responsibility

&gt; Buddha criticized the materialistic annihilationism view that denied rebirth and karma, states Damien Keown.[47] Such beliefs are inappropriate and dangerous, stated Buddha, because they encourage moral irresponsibility and material hedonism.

So it makes me feel as he's not treating these as hard truths, but just as a better life philosophy.

I’ve been interested in Buddhism for a while now - mainly due to my interest in achieving harmony with the universe, as well as my more anthropological interests - but I’ve been having a hard time differing between the different sects of Buddhism.

I know (mainly from trying to decipher and understand the overcomplicated Wikipedia pages)  there’s Mahāyāna and Theravada (from Sri Lanka?); but then there’s also Tibetan, Vajrayana, and Sangha. What is the difference between them all? Which one is “the best”? How did each develop? "

Buddhism,Posted this video somewhere else. All I see is a person talking about love. some dismiss this as Buddhisty stuff. I felt it disenfranchised the message as all the concepts she talks about are not at all inclusive to Buddhism. How do you see this video?,"https://youtu.be/6kUoTS3Yo4g


I just honestly think so many people have forgot what love is in our world. It’s people like her who can help remind us that love is a gift we give, not a prize that we take. No where else in the videos comments did I see anyone mention Buddhism. I feel this challenged some people where I posted of what they think love is. In which case I can see it easier to dismiss it based on the person’s garb 
rather than challenge one’s own view. In doing so they completely miss the message on a bias.

I usually don’t get so high strung but people make up whatever definition of love they want and I’ve seen it do great harm for personal gain. The Disney and Rom Com versions of love are unrealistic and toxic... atleast in the US I’ve never experienced any sort of healthy education on love. Not from my parents, not from the Catholic Church, not from school, and not from the majority of my romantic partners of my past. I think love is something so fragile and misunderstood that it does need protection. Once we lose the meaning what will it even mean to be human?

They say narcissistic and sociopaths are incapable of love and to me it is because they lack the ability to give without expecting something in return. There is also the bit of the lack of emotional experience which love is also a feeling. We give the gift of love when we feel it for someone to give them happiness. If they feel the same then they too repeat the process.

What she speaks about echos in other philosophies defining love, lust, and relationships all of which get confused. I honestly did not even think it was some
Buddhist teaching until someone mentioned it.

Buddhism,I’m not sure if craving or aversion or aversion of craving.,"I’m very confused about what is a smart decision in regards to diminishing craving or if it’s a type of justified aversion. 

My mindfulness has gotten to the point where The line between craving and aversion is blurred and every choice seems to be both craving and aversion simultaneously.

I’m going to use a personal example, but this is far from the only one I can give.

Recently I’ve been tasked to practice taking a specific standardized test to see if I would fit in that role. I don’t see the point in doing so and I find the process physically uncomfortable most of the time. Some days I just can’t bring myself to work at all. Am is this aversion or is it a recognition of craving to please people around and achieving a goal etc. I noticed that most of the things in a Worldly sense are actually pretty painful. Even pleasure and desire are a kind of agitation that damages the mind. 

The result of spending time with friends can be a fairly long “recovery “ to reality and some sense of equanimity.

Ultimately even asking this question is a bit of a craving vs aversion scenario.

I’m trying to live in this world while maintaining a level of none attachment and understanding through meditation, but I’m finding the dueling existence difficult.

Any grounded advice you can give would be appreciated.

Buddhism,Do you believe in Kali Yuga?,"Because when I have read the prophecies of Kali Yuga I have been haunted by them every bit. I have found every prediction made by the seers of the prior yuga to have truth to it. I see so many parallels between my own life and what the seers predicted. It seems the that the world is getting darker and darker each day.

There are four yugas and each one is represented on the leg of a bull. They are gold, silver, bronze and finally iron (the kali yuga). With each passing yuga a leg of the bull is lost and so a virtue. They are in order austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. In the kali yuga the final leg is said to be disentegrating more and more each day. I feel as if the world is descending into madness, and truth surely becoming more distant and ephemeral each day. Kali yuga IS madness, and I feel a hell in me. I know in my current state that I am impure and at times insane. 

I know there are sharp differences between hinduism and buddhism, but many Hindus/Buddhists coverge on the idea of Kali Yuga. Although they do not have an agreement on how it will ultimately play out. From what I gather the Hindus believe that (I think it was) the avater of Krishna will return to cleanse the earth of the sinners and reestablish his kingdom on earth . The buddhists think that the Buddha will return after armageddon reestablish peace on earth.

I'm probably completely butchering this, there is so much info on this topic and one wonders how much of it is true\accurate. That is not even including the fact that my memory could be causing me to completely skew the facts.

Many of you may not even believe in Kali yuga, or some of you might but see it as irrelevant to your practice, but I think it is a fascinating subject. It does really seem to me that we're living in an age of darkness.

What is your take on Kali Yuga? What is the Buddhists take on it? 

(And I know I've been critical of Buddhism before, but like I said, I have never been able to shake the idea of Kali Yuga. It's one of the ideas of Hinduism that stayed with me after Buddha's rejection of Atman/ Brahman)

Buddhism,"Thanissaro Bhikkhu is asked about the utility of Qigong to Anapanassati work (May 6, 2006, California)","From [""The Breath: A Vehicle for Liberation""](https://www.audiodharma.org/series/16/talk/1843/), (Part 2; 25:35-26:39)

**Question:**

My first experience with feeling the breath like that in the whole body and working with it was in training in qigong. Do you have any thoughts about the utility of using something like a qigong practice or.. a yoga pranayam practice with this work?

**Answer:**

It's helpful in getting you sensitive to the body. I myself haven't done that much qi- I've got one qigong exercise that I do.. and a little bit of yoga. And I found that it, you know, helps- I've actually found the breath work gets you better at qigong, and yoga. I think they- Both sides help each other.

The problem is in some pranayama exercises they actually have you control the breath too much. Because what we're doing to get in touch with here is ""What really feels best for the body right now?"", ""How are you directly experiencing the breath?"", and learn how to adjust the breath in line with what you're experiencing. The purpose of that is to refine your discernment."

Buddhism,A personal theory about the nature of samsara.,"Imagine a source of light, such as a sun, appearing in an endless dead void.

As the light spreads through the void, any region it reaches is first enlightened just a tiny bit. Gradually, more light seeps in. The region grows increasingly luminous, until eventually, there's no difference between it and the center of the light source. It has, in fact, become a new part of the original light source. The process continues in the same way, in regions beyond the one we just examined. The process as a whole can be described simply as the original light source **growing**.

Now consider the light source as Nibbana, the ultimate, infinite **freedom**. As it grows, it first creates regions with a tiny degree of freedom: **inanimate matter**. Which only has the freedom to take up space.

As more light seeps in, forms with greater degree of freedom are created: **living forms**.

Initially these are merely plants, which have very limited freedom, for example to grow and shape themselves.

Eventually animals will emerge. Animals have more freedom than plants, and as they evolve from simple single-cell organism, to more sophisticated complex organisms composed of numerous cells and organs, their degree of freedom grows.

They acquire growing levels of consciousness, and increasingly approach **contemplative consciousness**, which we have as humans and is a quantum leap in freedom, though in some ways a double-edged sword.

At some basic level, every thing which exists is endowed with a **tendency to exist**. In inanimate matter, this is manifest in how matter will remain the same - not change or move at all - unless forced to by some external force. Plants clearly struggle to survive, just consider the sapling or even blade of grass twisting itself towards the light necessary for its survival.

For every living thing, the desire to exist is clearly a fundamental quality. As the life form evolves, this desire is buttressed by instincts that grow ever more sophisticated, until they mature into **consciousness**, which in a sense is the ultimate survival instinct. The animal is now able to reflect about its own survival, and thus secure it far more effectively, notably by responding to external (desirable) opportunities and (undesirable) threats.

The drive to survive becomes increasingly more conscious and deliberate, until it ripens fully into **contemplative consciousness**, which allowed us humans to build weapons and forts and granaries and take over the planet. However, contemplative consciousness can direct itself freely towards any object, including - reflectively - **its own self**, its own nature and the very nature of existence (which is of course a purely mental phenomena - we are not aware of anything outside our consciousness, including its sense impressions and thoughts. Literally nothing else exists for us, and existence itself is consciousness.)

This level of consciousness is the ultimate goal of the process because **such consciousness can contemplate and ultimate realize its own true nature**. This teaching is not exclusive to Buddhism or even all of Eastern philosophy: The maxim ""know thyself"" was carved into the gate of the Temple of Apollo - God of reason - in Delphi, and later made a cornerstone of Western philosophy by Socrates and Plato.

Indeed, this knowledge isn't so much **learning of the new**, but **a return** to the source of infinite knowledge. With enlightenment, consciousness is able to **come back to its source**, the great light whence its own light came: Nibbana. For example, Socrates taught there is no such thing as ""learning something new"", only **remembering that which is already there but obscured by ignorance**. It's all there, just obscured by the veil of avijjā. Sounds familiar?

What I like about this theory is that it elegantly answers a question that bothered me for a while: **the nature of the defilements**.

According to this theory, the defilements are not some external pollution, but just **a primitive state of enlightenment**. The defiled state is merely **a state of transition between absent and absolute freedom**. It's a spectrum stretching from complete ignorance (absence of life) to full knowledge, realization, and freedom.

Contemplative consciousness, and its functional product - free will - allow us to reverberate any sensation by reflecting upon it.

As stated before, this is a double edged sword.

We can choose to reflect, and thus multiply, upon our own survival instincts. That is an extremely popular topic of contemplation, given how prominent these instincts are for us, descendants of animals, and can be seen as quite natural given how consciousness itself can be seen as a product of these survival instincts and a sophisticated tool for survival.

Contemplating upon our survival instincts multiplies them ad-infinitum, such that simple animal instincts for food and safety are multiplied into greed, and greed becomes infinite - an infinite hunger, first for sensual stimulation, but later, when the capacity of our senses to take in more stimulation is exhausted, we **abstract our desires** into purely symbolic forms: hunger for infinite amounts of power, money, ""fame"", etc.

This is how karma is created.

This self-reflecting, self-reverberating process can amplify every sensation. That is why humans can suffer so much more than animals, let alone plants or inanimate objects.

An animal will always be struck by the single arrow alone. A human, contemplating this strike, will reverberate it, striking his own self with the second, third, fourth, any number of arrows of repeated conscious thought.

The most evolved humans, with the greatest level of consciousness, are thus those with the greatest capacity to inflict suffering upon themselves.

This whole process of conscious, deliberate contemplation is the root of karma, and I expect that animals cannot create karma, or only minimally, due to their nearly absent level of consciousness.

This is the capacity of the beings with contemplative consciousness: to **ill-use it to amplify their own attachments**. The principal attachment to existence, which Buddhism calls taṇhā, and its two subsidiaries: desire for states that appear to aid and enhance survival (lobha), aversion for states that seem to hinder and diminish survival (dosa). These are both accompanied by the necessary factor that will makes attachment to existence itself seem crucial: the obscuration of the light source whence consciousness originated, or in Buddhist terms **its own true nature**. Or in Pali, moha.

So far about the capacity of contemplative consciousness to amplify its base instincts and create karma. But it can also be directed towards itself, and if done correctly, realize its own true nature.

In this process, it will realize that **the self is nothing more than a powerful, involved, and sophisticated complex of survival instincts**.

The ultimate achievement possible for consciousness can be attained with correct direction at contemplating its own self, raising doubt at its instinctual representation of the world (name and form, nama rupa) as a symbolic battleground of desire and aversion, where the goal is survival and existence. Exposing delusions such as the possibility of physical forms persisting forever, without change or death - the ultimate survival fantasy, the delusion to satisfy all our primitive instinctual drives to survive. Or another delusion, that if only we attain our next goal - that next promotion, sexual conquest, house, car, extra figure in our bank balance - we will abide in eternal bliss in this very life. Of course, our instincts will never relent in their battle to survive and multiply, our happiness is not their goal, and reaching any milestone will only allow them to pull us pitilessly towards the next, until we exhaust our survival and procreation potential and our body breaks apart.

(There are associated delusions, mostly symbolic. For example, most people delude themselves that they can continue ""living"" through their children, legacy, people who remember them, etc - thus the fear of ""being forgotten"", and all our weird rituals around death and commemorating the dead.)

By realizing our true nature, our inseparable union with the great light source - Nibbana - we can abandon the primitive halfway state of existence. As we progress towards this realization, it is as if our bodies become more illuminated. Eventually, there is only the light, and physical existence is abandoned.

This can also be conceptualized as a gradual process of **refining one substance to another**. For example, refining crude oil into gasoline. Initially there is just crude oil (or more accurately, there is nothing). Then there's 1%, 2%, 3% gasoline (or more luminous). Increasingly, the partially refined substance exhibits less qualities of the crude oil (dumb, compulsive attachment) and more qualities of the gasoline (infinite freedom). Eventually, there is only gasoline (or pure light without darkness, or the opposite of nothing: everything).

The defiled state is just a half-state somewhere between these two extremes.

I very much welcome comments. To give some context, this theory was born out of intense contemplation of a question that always bothered me: why are there defilements?

It's the best explanation I found so far, and I rather like it, though try not to get too attached ;-)"
Buddhism,How does Buddhism feel about the merging of religions?,"To put in some context in terms of what I believe about God and the afterlife I would consider myself a Christian, but in terms of what I believe here on earth I believe a combination of Buddhism and Christianity (specifically the teachings of Jesus). Over the past few years Buddhism and Christianity have somewhat merged to me, where in the basics of religion and religious topics I am very Christian but my attitude towards life and people is very Buddhist. The more I think about it the less I see a conflict between the two, they combine quite nicely the way I go about it. This may result in my not being totally 100% Christian (I don’t believe all of the Bible actually happened but I do believe in the Christian holy trinity) or 100% Buddhist (I don’t believe in reincarnation but I read and follow a lot of Buddha’s teachings) but I’m okay with that I was just wondering what Buddhism thought about that scenario. 

I see a large amount of similarities between Christianity and Buddhism too, the concept of Karma could be tied to divine intervention or even the concept of heaven or hell. Also, the Holy Spirit of Christianity can easily be seen as a spirituality that ties all living things together. 

Just wanted some feedback of what I’ve been thinking. Thank you! "

Buddhism,Mahayana is as old and as valid as Theravada,"// lots of as's in that sentence

// i know it is long, but it's in verse form

&amp;#x200B;

Buddha set the example to walk far and wide and teach everyone.

In the Buddha's time each practice center had a few realized teachers who led dozens of students.

At the beginning, the prophesied decline of the Dharma did happen!

These realized beings spread out further to reach more sentient beings who may have the karma for realizations.

This is old times, so they become too distant to communicate easily.

Absorbed in the moment, they exist.

Walking towards whatever students may have the karma to hear the Dharma.

Eventually, the amount of students with the karma to hear the Dharma became frighteningly low.

Foreseeing this crisis, the Council of Arhats meeting gathered as many as could be reached.

At once, they systemized the transmission of Buddha Dharma before the living Arya transmission died completely in the region.

Not everyone got the message.

Some were too far north past the Himalayas. Dangerous treks and bitter resolve to spread the Buddhadharma got them there.

With hope and students, they migrated because of the Buddha's mention that the Dharma would do well in the North in the future.

Years passed. The student-teacher tradition continued separately of the mechanized formatting.

As teacher's thinned and beings karma diminished in the North, the low faculty bodhisattva path opened wider and wider as a source of hope.

Eventually, the students of the more distant sects became communicable again.

The success of the mechanization was so inspiring for the remaining Northern gurus (who each took on hundreds of students out of compassion)

The Mahayana sutras were born. Borrowing and adding their own stories and renditions, they also mechanized the transmission of Dharma.

Another period of time later - hundreds of years after the last Arya died - hope reemerged.

Nagarjuna was born.

He tended to the doctrine's wounds using the currently established tradition of mechanization and logic.

He inspired practitioners and householders far and wide with his vast realization, accomplishment, and earned influence in the kingdom.

The doctrine was reborn.

We must make it last until Maitreya can reinvigorate it.

Practice ardently.

You will gain the realizations you aim for.

Set your hopes high to keep the Dharma alive.

&amp;#x200B;

A point for another day:

From Nagarjuna, some of the tantras are healed and transmitted with mechanized 'secret' transmission.

Future practitioners are gifted with buried treasures full of Arya authored texts that didn't survive the living transmission.

These collections are added to the mechanized teachings if the finder's story is believable.

Regardless, these collections are brought back into the light and spread.

After several more generations, people began to understand the 'hidden' meaning of the mechanized teachings again.

Dozens of practitioners realized full Enlightenment and restarted the living Arya transmission.

Hope is important for practice.

True or not, the living Arya transmission continues today.

Buddhism,Help Your Anxiety With a Tiny Black Octopus,"Most of us are aware of the fact that we more or less are trained to escape negative feelings at all costs. Although we know that our attempts to escape these feelings by distraction and such make things worse, we still tend to do it. Thankfully, one of the things Buddhism can teach us is that these negative feelings are not the enemy, even if they feel pretty much like that.

Before we get started, here are a couple of things you need

1. anxiety, at least level 6
2. a tiny black octopus
3. a little mindfulness, time, curiosity and imagination

Let's start at point 2, because I assume that when you read this text you are already skilled enough with having anxiety. But because anxiety always feels at least like level 6, you can also start as a beginner.

First, let's pick up your tiny black octopus. It's cute, always a bit wet, usually it smiles but sometimes it can also look at you a little sad and afraid. In any case, you have to take care of it and treat it like it's you own beloved fragile child. Next time you are going for a walk, like for groceries or whatever, take one of its tentacles by the hand. This small little friend represents, or no, if fact it actually IS your anxiety.

**How to feed it:**  If you like, you can feed your little octopus by trying to not pay attention to it or even ignore it. It instantly grows bigger by feeding it with some of your distractions, by feeding it with superseding and superimposing thoughts or feelings and by feeding it with tasks and problems that you should address but set aside. Everytime you put yourself in such a harmful behavior, it grows to protect you from that. Finally it becomes a nasty, huge kraken monster.

**How to shrink it:** If it gets too big you may feel uncomfortable with it, especially because now it's holding YOUR hand. The good news is, even if it looks like a monster, it's always your friend and really just wants to protect you. So listen to it. You can easily shrink it down just by gently caring about it, paying attention and being aware of it. This way you can always change its size at any time. Like with all pets, you have to train it a little in the beginning, but it learns pretty fast.

Now that we have our little octopus friend in mind and know how to treat it, we will automatically be more aware about our distractions and things we don't address. Finally we learn, how to better communicate with ourselves and others.

Buddhism,What I tell myself when I’m dealing with Social Anxiety,"I’ve struggled a lot with social anxiety throughout my life. One of the things I would try to tell myself in those moments of anxiety was “stop giving a fuck about what other people think about you.”

But that would only sorta help. It wasn’t great for me because I *do* give a fuck about what other people think. Buddhism has taught me so much and I place a great deal of importance on compassion for others. Telling myself to not care about what they think just didn’t feel right.

So what I recently realized is that the goal is not to not give a fuck about what others think. The goal is to *not try to change what others think about me*. I don’t know what they think, but whatever it is, it’s OK. This simple realization has been huge for me. So I now have a mantra to help me with social anxiety that also aligns with my Buddhist beliefs.

Maybe someone else has had a similar struggle, so I wanted to share."
Buddhism,I need help letting go of negative emotions.,"I'm very new to Buddhism. 

Im a pretty happy person but I've become fairly sensitive to things lately and find myself getting upset at small things. This happens the most in my relationship. 

When I get upset about something I have a very hard time getting over it in a timely matter. Are there any tips for letting go?

 It feels as if the negative feeling is a physical obstacle, like a wall, and I just can't get around it. I usually do, but like I said, not very quickly. Even if I know it's pointless to be upset, I just can't drag myself out of the hole I feel I'm in. I've always been quite stubborn, and it feels like I'm being stubborn with myself. When I'm upset and don't want to be, or realize it's pointless, I almost feel like it would be silly to just snap out of it and be in a good mood again. I think I'm worried about the judgments of other if I do this, but not for a reason, at least that I'm aware of. I've always felt this way. I'm fully aware that this is a bit absurd, but it's been very hard to get over. Any tips or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

At the end of the video I cried. Buddha said if you don't fear death then it holds no power over you and then he said that the only way to end suffering is by not wanting, but only giving and receiving. 

This had such a profound effect on me for some reason. Everything became so clear to me. He's right about everything. 

I felt so calm, so forgiving, far less angry, I thought before I spoke and I was able to concentrate so much better. I've never felt like this before in my whole life.

The alright brother seen him around every now and then. He'd always come up and ask him if he could have some money stating it was for his mother. The alright brother gave when he could knowing he was being lied to. Every time the other brother sees the alright brother he will start a banter with him that always ends with, ""Hey can you spare $5, $10, $20?"" The alright brother gives whatever he can knowing that there is a great chance this money will be drank away or injected up the other brother's arm.

So, I am alright brother as you've probably discerned. I would like to think my action and giving is pure thinking if he is really hard up and needs food or clothes or something he'd spend it on that, but part of me knows he will just use it for drugs and alcohol.  He asked. I had it to spare and so I gave freely.

Buddhism,What are the defilements (kleshas) in non-dualist Buddhism?,"The defilements in dualist (e.g. Sravaka) Buddhism are straightforward:

They are 3 unwholesome elements - lust, aversion, and ignorance - which are eliminated in the process of awakening. The entire Eightfold Path is a life plan to eliminate these defilements, first by removing gross defilements manifest in action (sila), then temporarily detaching and excising them through the training of concentration (samadhi), until their final elimination by penetrating insight (panna).

But how does one conceptualize the defilements (kleshas) within a non-dualistic framework?

I'm especially curious about their conceptualization within a yogacara framework, such as the Chan Buddhist school.

Observe how all their defining features in Sravakayana are invalid in yogacara:

1. You can't call anything ""unwholesome"". In fact, labeling or perceiving anything as unwholesome is a mark of ignorance, since it violates basic principles of non-dualism.
2. Nor can you separate anything out, or aim to eliminate it, or even just believe such elimination is at all possible. The idea that anything can be ""eliminated"" at any level more profound than conventional form - and even then, only as a manner of speaking - is ignorant Wrong View.

In short, the very concept of ""defilements"" as taught in Sravaka is Wrong View in yogacara, or more charitably - skillful means (Upaya).

As a sidenote, I do believe it's hard to reconcile a dualist approach with the Pali Canon, since it's unclear how anything can be truly separate - let alone eliminated - in a huge system of conditioned phenomena that forever affect each other without fail. For example, we can burn a wooden cottage, but that doesn't truly ""eliminate"" anything: it just modifies a form. So the matter of the wood was transformed to ash, heat, and gas. The latter two we don't see, but it's ignorant even at a mundane level to believe they don't exist.

It's not easy to explain how anything can be ""unwholesome"", and I believe it is indeed never explained in the Canon. I vaguely recall that the question of ""what are the kleshas, why do they exist?"" was one of the questions the Buddha refused to answer. Either way, I believe it is left unanswered in the Canon.

Non-dualism eliminates the whole question; a radical, powerful answer to irreconcilable questions that plagued not just Eastern, but Western philosophers as well. In Yogacara, there can be nothing ""bad"", and no ""defilements"". However, then we have to explain Buddhism again, since the ""purifying defilements"" narrative as laid out in the first paragraph will no longer serve.

This is what this questions is about."

&gt;1.1 No arising and no ceasing

&gt;No permanence and no diference

&gt;No identity and no difference

&gt;No arriving and no departing

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;1.2 To the one who can expound this matter of causality

&gt;And completely extinguish all sophistries

&gt;I bow my head in reverence:

&gt;The Buddha, greatest of all teachers.

Question: Why was this treatise composed?

Reply: There are some who say that all things arise from the god 'Great Self-Being' [Maheshvara]. Some say that they arise from Visnu, some say that they arise from combination, some say that they arise from time, some say that they arise from the world-nature, some say that they arise from transformations, some say that they arise spontaneously and some say that they arise from atoms. Because they hold to these various errors they fall into false views such as that things have no cause, or some wrong cause, that they are permanent or that they are cut off, and so on. In various ways they expound 'I' and 'mine', but they do not know the true Dharma. The Buddha, desiring to terminate all such false views and to make known the Buddha-dharma, first taught the twelve causal links in the Sravaka-dharma; but also, for the benefit of those who have already applied themselves, who have the great mind and who are capable of receiving the profound Dharma, he expounded in the Mahayana-dharma the characteristics of causality, namely that all dharmas neither arise nor cease, are not the same, do not differ and so on; they are utterly empty and devoid of anything which exists. As is stated in the Prajnaparamita Sutra, 'The Buddha told Subhuti: When a Bodhisattva is established in the seat of enlightenment, he views the twelve causal links as like the inexhustibility of empty space'.

After the Buddha's decease, in the second five hundred years of the patterned [i.e. Semblance] Dharma, men's faculties became dulled, they became deeply attached to all dharmas, and sought for settled, fixed characteristics in the twelve causal links, the five skandhas, the twelve avenues, the eighteen realms, and so on. They did not know the Buddha's intention and were merely attached to words and letters. Hearing utter emptiness taught in the Mahayana-dharma they did not know the reason for things being empty, and so conceived doubts and views, such as 'If all things are utterly empty how can you differentiate sin and merit, karmic recompense and so on? If this were so, there would be no worldly truth and no truth of the supreme meaning'. They seized hold of the characteristic of 'emptiness' and produced voracious attachments, generating all sorts of errors about utter emptiness. It was for such reasons as these that the Bodhisattva Nagarjuna composed this Middle Treatise.
"
Buddhism,Beauty is Fundamentally Excellence.,"What is beauty? Beauty is fundamentally excellence.  
To find beauty in the world is to recognize a pure radiating excellence, an uncontaminated innocence; it is the blameless.  
What is it to be beyond blame? To be beyond shame? It's not to be wrong. It's not to be right.  
It is to be correct, to be correct in your thoughts in how you model reality in your mind such that you are awake enough to manifest the best possible future that ""could be"" but which is actually simultaneous with the life-timeline on which you currently traveling by choice of your uncountable decisions you make every day.  
Every moment is the eternal present. There is notime else other than this moment, now alone.  
In this moment now alone is discovered the unfathomable mystery of choice, this incredibly strange capacity to know we can choose between destinies which span a limitless spectrum of possibility. This is not a trivial matter. This fact of our immediate experience is of profound and urgently important significance.  
So to be beyond being wrong in some way in thinking, articulation or action is the way to blamelessness.  
The blameless are the innocent, and it is the innocent that shine with a radiance that is undeniable and completely obvious to those others that are also blameless. Do not confuse this state of blamelessness with psychopathy or sociopathy. The innocent are the non-guilty. They are not blameless because they are insane and have no conscience. It is precisely because they choose to persist to remain awake in this one and only eternal moment that they wield responsibility to inject meaning and love into the world by committing to the correct, not the wrong, not the right, but devoting themselves to the correct, which is essentially identical with an imperishable love for truth.  
What is true is the beautiful. Truth, beauty, innocence, blamelessness, correctness, excellence.  
What is beautiful is the correct in truth, the sole worship of the blameless.  
You cannot be guilty as long as you are eternally choosing to awaken from the dark dreams of fear that have haunted your soul forever.  
There is no end. There is no beginning. There is only choosing in this one eternal moment that simultaneously is unfolding one of an infinite range of possible to manifest destinies so incomprehensibly vast to the mind it can easily be forgotten. All those possible futures are simultaneously existing with the present circumstance in which you find yourself. By instrumentality of choice you select which timeline that currently exists at this only moment which you have to decide or not decide, and choosing not to decide is still deciding anyhow.  
Devote yourself as much as you are able, as much as you can, and as much as you are willing to the pursuit of the most true, the most beautiful, and the most good. The only way to become a buddha is not to decide to do so. You just do it.  
You will be aware you are choosing at first, but you will learn to choose so well that you won't notice yourself doing it.  
That is going beyond trying. There is no try; but do, or do not.  
The skill of choosing correctly and naturally is what shines as excellence as it is increasingly mastered.  
That is why beauty is fundamentally excellence, because in the excellence is the mastery of having transcended choice and hesitation.  
You have regained awareness of Now and have refound the Flow.  
No longer is there any doubt as to what is the correct action.  
Right seeing, right action. No lack of attention, no wrong action."

Buddhism,What is it called when...?,"Hello,

I have a question regarding what its called when you move from being in your head... and even from simple feeling of the body...

To a rooted clarity where you see clearly the function of things - and feel its connection to life.  Where you are rooted in the physicality of things, you see ""through"" the rules, culture, story of men. You see simply.  A house is a structure that people use for shelter and safety. Juxtaposed to this simplicity is the crazy story of man. (your story, too even, comes clear, you see the outlines of it)

This is not just ""Grounded"" typically? 

Is this ""before thinking mind"" or ""clear mind"" ? What are other names this mind has in certain traditions.

Thank you."
Buddhism,A meditation from HH Dalai Lama to soften the heart,"I've been reading HH Dalai Lama's book *How to Practice* and it's really struck a chord inside me. There's one meditation he suggests that really opened my eyes. I thought I'd share it here:

1. Remain calm and reasonable. 
2. In front of you to the right, imagine another version of yourself, egotistical and self-centered.
3. In front of you to the left, imagine a group of poor people, suffering beings who are unrelated to you--neither friend nor enemy. 
4. Observe these two sides from your calm vantage point. Now think, ""Both want happiness. Both want to get rid of suffering. Both have the right to accomplish these goals.""
5. Consider this: Just as usually we are willing to make temporary sacrifices for a greater long-term good, so too the benefit of the larger number of suffering beings to your left is much more important than this single egotistical person on your right. Notice your mind naturally turning to the side of the greater number of people. 


I noticed a sensation of softening in my chest immediately when I performed this meditation. When I performed this meditation before metta meditation, my metta was much more sincere and natural. 

In fact, I spontaneously performed a modified version of the metta meditation: 

1. First stage: I wished myself well and happiness.
2. I wished a dear friend happiness and wellness.
3. I wished a stranger happiness and wellness.
4. I pictured all the worst qualities in myself, all my neurosis and habits and negativity. I wished that mass of suffering wellness and happiness. 
5. I wished all living beings wellness and happiness.

It can be very educational to place our own worst qualities in the place of a foe or enemy. I experienced a deeper sense of integration and wholeness after, and I usually struggle very much with wishing myself well.

Others who struggle with wishing themselves well might try this technique. 

Thanks for reading. :) May you be well and happy."
Buddhism,Buddhism and Food,"I was reading this Buddhist verse that is said before eating food, and I really resonated with it: 

&amp;#x200B;

""We reflect on the effort that brought us this food and consider how it comes to us. We reflect on our virtue and practice, and whether we are worthy of this offering. We regard it as essential to keep the mind free from excesses such as greed. We regard this food as good medicine to sustain our life. For the sake of enlightenment, we now receive this food.""

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently on a path to learn more about Buddhism to apply in my life. I started reading Pema Chodron, Start Where You Are, as a good starting place (recommended by people on this forum). I do not have a healthy relationship with food. Reading that book and reading this passage got me to thinking....I would like to have better compassion for myself in relation to food/eating, be more thankful for the food I receive, be more mindful and intentional about what I'm putting in my body. That seems to fall in line with what Buddhism would be about (correct me if I am wrong). 

Since there are so many wise and beautiful people here, I thought I would reach out to ask you all about your experiences with engaging with Buddhism and how you relate to food in a way that is healthy. I apologize in advance for possibly getting some Buddhist concepts incorrect! And thank you!"

I just read a post on emergency personnel and their stories from mass shootings (Yes grim, but it was meant to spread awareness).

Buddhism,Im struggling to understand emptiness.,"Prior to the past few weeks, Ive heard it just in passing as a sort of Truth I should accept. That everything is empty and nothing is solid. Okay. And my basic understanding of physics, biology etc shows some form of that to be true. The atoms that made up a blade of grass were all once something else, maybe a fly or a cloud. The big bang originated all of the matter we see in the universe today, even us. I get that. 

I also get how the thoughts we have, arent solid. Meditation has shown me this clearly. Those are fabrications of energy (""emotion"") and word formations. Okay. I get that.

But when people like, say, Rob Burbea go on about how everything is inherently empty, literally everything, I get a bit frustrated because Im like, what do you MEAN by that. I know there is matter. I know that even though all items are processes, came from change and will change in the future, they have *some* existence that I am witnessing, using, touching, etc. How can that be ""empty""? Fleeting, sure. In constant flux? Yes. Empty? ??

A part of me feels like insisting on describing these things as ""empty"" rather than ""processes"" or ""temporary"" is a kind of... ""woah I wanna blow your mind"" type terminology that doesnt actually point to anything different from what the latter two words do. Yet I really enjoy Rob Burbeas teachings (I know of course hes not the only source of emptiness teachings, hes just a teacher Ive been recently exploring who considers it very important) and I know hes not trying to just exaggerate or whatever.

But someone who understands, can you point me towards some clearer picture of whats being painted here? Id really like to know the big secret. And also what relevance there is to stream entry in understanding/seeing ""emptiness"" as opposed to understanding ""flux"" or ""dependent arising""."

Buddhism,How to cease specific suffering?,"Here’s the background: a recent post here contributed to my revelation. To the right is me, ego and selfish and suffering because of desire. He doesn’t want me like I want him to. 

If I do certain things to get him to want me, there is an entire group of people to the left who will suffer. And my suffering wouldn’t go away, it would change but it would still be there.

The solution is the cessation of my desire for him. That’s what will help me, help this group of people not to suffer, etc. I am motivated to do this because making that group of people suffer would be horrible.

I know the Eightfold path is the way to stop suffering/desire in general, but that seems daunting. I want to stop this particular desire and see how that goes...I am motivated.

But how do I do it? "
Buddhism,The Buddhist Cosmos by Punnadhammo Mahathero - Jataka 273 (NSFW?),"I’ve just been reading an excellent ebook: “A comprehensive survey of the early Buddhist worldview; according to Theravada and Sarvastivada sources by Punnadhammo mahathero of Arrow river forest hermitage, Canada  ” called ‘The Buddhist Cosmos’

[Link to the book](https://www.arrowriver.ca/book/cosmoBook.php)

I’m not half way through yet but I felt I needed to share this story I’ve just encountered, it took my by surprise and made me laugh quite hard. 

This story is a Jataka Tale (273) apparently not translated into English in the PTS

Here is the story as rendered in ‘The Buddhist Cosmos’

Long ago, when Brahmadatta was King of Bārāṇasi, the Bodhisatta was born as a brahmin who renounced sense pleasures to live as a hermit by the banks of the Gaṅgā in the Himavā. One day while he was sitting in the doorway of his hut, a bold and wicked monkey (makkaṭa) came up and tried to put its penis in his ear. The Bodhisatta prevented him from doing this, and retained his equanimity.
Sometime later, it happened that a tortoise came up out of the Gaṅgā River and lay sleeping on the bank with its mouth open. The naughty monkey (lola-vānara) seeing this stuck its penis into the tortoise’s mouth. Waking up, the tortoise snapped its jaws shut like someone closing the lid of a chest, which was very painful for the monkey.

Unable to bear the pain, the monkey wondered, “Who can free me from this suffering? Who can I go to for help? Only the ascetic can free me, it is proper that I go and see him.” Carrying the tortoise in his hands, the monkey went to see the Bodhisatta who spoke to him in verse:

*What, is that your alms-bowl?
You have quite a handful, brahmin.
Where did you go for alms?
What lay followers did you approach?*

The monkey replied, also in verse:

*I am a foolish monkey (kapi)
I have touched that which should not be touched.
If you would be so good as to free me,
I will go away to the mountains*

The Bodhisatta then addressed the tortoise:

*Tortoises are of the Kassapa clan,
Monkeys (makkaṭa) are Koṇḍañña clansmen.
Kassapa, release Kondañña,
You are committing sexual misconduct*.

The tortoise was pleased with the words of the Bodhisatta and released the monkey’s penis. Being freed, the monkey bowed to the Bodhisatta and ran away without looking back

Buddhism,Tips for dealing with restlessness?,"Since I started actively practicing Buddhism more and more in daily life, I noticed my anxiety and stress pretty much dissipated. 

Now I feel that a part of me is thinking ""yes, now we are actually getting things done, like we always wanted to!"" and it produces a constant enthusiastic restlessness. I see it for the hindrance it is, and how it negatively impacts me:

* when I meditate, my brain goes like ""Do we still need to do this? We already trained ourselves out of the biggest hindrances. We could be spending this time working and getting more done! How about we plan our day while we're just sitting here?""
* when talking to my boyfriend, if it's about a topic I am less interested in, the restlessness pops up again: ""Maybe we should stop this idle chatting and get to work?"". Though I think listening and learning more about his interests is an important part of a relationship, and usually quite enjoyable too.
* when doing chores, the nagging voice tells me ""rush rush rush, we have lots of work to do today!""
* when talking to clients, the voice thinks ""why are we wasting time going over useless things? Let me just work on the project!""
* I sometimes play a video game to relax. A new expansion for it is coming out soon. I have lost my enjoyment of it, as I keep thinking how much more awesome it will be once I have that too!
* I am excited about things to come (e.g. getting a new computer and workout machine on Black Friday), and my mind keeps being drawn to daydreaming about what I will do once it happens.

My current strategy is to just re-focus the brain on the here and now whenever I catch myself dwelling on these things.

Do you have any other tips, dharma talks, or books/articles on how to deal with this?"

Buddhism,Struggling with “The Heart of Buddha’s Teaching”,"Hi all. I’ve wanted to learn about Buddhism for a long time. I’ve picked up books along the way without success. Came here and saw many recommendations for Thich Nhat Hanh’s The Heart of Buddha’s Teaching. Got it from the library and have struggled for a few weeks with it. 

My first observation is Buddhism is extremely complicated. So much terminology and an incredible amount of lists of things. I have trouble digesting many sentences let alone paragraphs.

Reading didn’t make me feel bad, I just get the feeling of walking through a gallery of portraits. They are lovely but after my fiftieth portrait I really don’t have anything more I can absorb. I’ve put down the book. Read short chunks and then longer. In the end I don’t remember much of the specifics. 

I get very confused about things and don’t know whether I should believe things exist or they don’t, they are connected or they aren’t, or I have a self or I don’t. And the lists. Lists within lists and sub lists. I forced myself to finish half the book then skimmed the rest. 

Question is, are there more basic but still authentic Buddhism? I’m motivated to learn but really struggling to comprehend or absorb anything. How do people approach study of Buddhism without getting overwhelmed by information?"

I would like to ask/ know:
1. is there any guideline in Buddhism that family come first? Or in general everyone is equal?
As My big family consider is a traditional Buddhist family, I ask this question because some of my big family is prefer to choose everyone is equal. She treat other family member same as she treat other people that need help. 
Example: One of the family member has mild disability. We all family member have routine task to do every week. She insisted every family member have to do their part regarding has or not mild disability. So while other family member agree to cover the schedule of member that has mild disability, she prefer do equally schedule without need to cover the  of member that has mild disability. 
I sad, as she consider active volunteering in 1-2 big and well organized Buddhist temples and others non-profit humanity organization, but simply can't help little extra to own family member that has mild disability.
If there is a guide in Buddhism for family come first, can share what actually written in Buddhist book/ sutra?

2. Many times, I heard from Dharma talk or read from Buddhist book/ article about don't mind to be taken advantage.
But those stories/ articles are not mention what is the limit of don't mind to be taken advantage? or there is no limit?
What actually written in Buddhist book/ sutra about don't mind to be taken advantage?
Also how to stop to be feel be taken advantage?

Thanks in advance for any sharing opinion."

I'm not a big reader, but if you guys could steer me in the right direction I'd greatly appreciate it. Influential people, quotes, concepts, ideals, anything. I just know that, so far, this has been the only thing from which I'm able to draw at least some meaning and that's important.

Buddhism,Does detachment lead to the fulfillment of desires?,"I have noticed, when I have a desire for something, it usually evades me, but as soon as I detach myself from the desire, the desire starts to manifest itself in my life. Whenever I am in a calm state(post meditation), life just feels easier and in harmony. I feel luckier than usual, as if whatever desire I have, the probability of it manifesting increases. For example, yesterday I was playing soccer and was trying too hard and failing miserably but then I stopped caring and I started finding myself at the right positions at the right time and I wasn't even trying, it was happening automatically. This sort of thing has happened in all sectors of my life by now and being a believer in science I am finding a hard time in coming up with a rationally consistent explanation for the coincidences I have experienced after meditating and achieving detachment from my desires. I am curious as to whether such phenomenon has been experienced by others as well and if yes, then what was your experience? Also are there any teachings in Buddhism that have talked  about this? "

Buddhism,I need some help on my path,"I am very new to the Buddhist path and have been working to be more mindful and compassionate and patient with those around me and myself in general.

 I work at a Hospital in a rural area that is ravaged by drug addiction and the actions that come with drugs. At times I find it very difficult to suppress or stop thoughts about certain persons that may be negative or otherwise derogatory because their actions in the hospital or the actions that led them to their visit and in some cause they incarceration (we get a fair amount of prisoners on my unit)

 I can understand that not everyone makes the choice to become addicted to drugs, and that not everyone choses to live the way some people have to. Poverty has a crippling hold over the people in this area and from it comes desperation and depression which can lead a person down the wrong path.

 Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on how I can work to be more kind and compassionate to these people who have done terrible things to others and to my coworkers and myself?

Buddhism,Why am I getting feelings of loneliness when I get glimpses of non-ego?,"I've been having sporadic, millisecond-long experiences where I associate the word ""I"" with the Universe rather than the body or the brain. Most of the time when it occurs I start sporadically laughing from my belly, but sometimes I start feeling lonely instead. It's along the lines of truly feeling ""I"" am the One. And if I'm the One, even if I have lots of other perspectives (other people, etc), there's really nothing else. It's just I, and it makes me feel lonely. I'm assuming whatever glimpses I'm getting are illusions rather than waking up, but I'm honestly confused. Is this a normal feeling on the path to enlightenment?

For clarification, I'm not talking about loneliness in regards to other people. I'm talking about loneliness as the One, knowing that I am all there is, and there's nothing else."

The album is called Doha.

'Doha' means songs of realisation, or songs of experience.  
The term is originally Sanskrit but probably best known in relation to the song of Mahamudra by Tilopa.  
A Doha is an expression of an individual's spiritual understandings in the form of rhyming couplets. This is a Doha for modern times.

may it spark some contemplation.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the lyrics from the intro to get a sense of what the offering is about:

&amp;#x200B;

just a maverick speaking his mind   
sat nav on the atlas never could find   
this little blip on the map until I spit you these raps   
and on these tracks you'll surmise just a piece of my life   
hail from Christchurch, place that nurtured my birth   
and where I used to reside but now the city is cursed   
you see poseidon   
stuck his mighty trident in the dirt and made the earth come alive   
and now the city is dying   
and insidious minds are on the rise and the shittiest vibe   
is what I find, suicide crisis taking numerous lives   
they just be losing their minds and now my homies are dying   
and I am crying   


but through the stress and the mess there is a blessing   
the Wangapeka centre I'm forever indebted   
With the breath as my tether I see the depths of my fetters   
They be embedded and netted in repetitive sentences in the back of my head   
with peace and acceptance I see I cease to abet it   
just release and forget it and see annicca is prevalent   
no endeavour to be better just see clear   
and penetrate deep states   


till each letter of each sentence that this being'll be penning   
will be blessings or teach lessons or be as a means to relieve tension   
you're seeing the seed of my deep intention, if beings need healing I'll heed with attention   
this pen'll be bleeding till beings see freedom   
it's never depleted I'm never receding   


and i'm just saying aspirations   
but if I can take my pain and my grace and be creative   
and offer it, in the midst of constant ponderings   
then maybe there's a mate who relates and finds some solace   
And on a good day, maybe it could stimulate   
a bit of contemplation, create a state of straight amazement   
then I could say that I'm pleased I went and made it   
and laid these tracks down and gave away them for the taking.

It has been going so well that They have contracted me to build and teach a 30-day course over the fundamentals of Buddhist practice, thought, and philosophy.

I have a live and let live attitude, as long as you don' bother others, your pathway is valid.

I think I may suffer from ocd intrusive thoughts. I don't wanna say I do for definite cos I haven't been officially diagnosed, but everything seems to align with that specifically.

So as some of ya'll will know, today is 11/11/18 (depending on what time zone you're in). I try to be a spiritual person but I also feel very drawn to Buddhism too. 1111 is said to be a spiritual number. Now I am currently doing NoFap and unfortunately relapsed today, and as a result, my mind is telling me that I will become the things I fear because I relapsed on 1111 (11/11).

I know it sounds ridiculous, but it can really make me feel anxious at times. So my question to you guys is, how do I let this go and realise that I will NOT become what I fear because I relapsed on a date that has spiritual significance?

Now, I have this doubt... to which degree should one be passive regarding acceptance?

I mean: one girl gets traumatized with a rape in her past, so she should give up sex for the rest of her life? Or then... a guy had a panic attack and developed agoraphobia, not going out anymore due to fear... should this guy just be passive and accept his new life of not going out home until the end of his life?

How does the 'acceptance' thing should be faced when one have very limiting traumas? Am I getting the wrong message here? Maybe it's acceptance about the feeling of fear that you will need to overcome the situations... I don't know. But is determination and fighting for your goals always bad?

Buddhism,"For converts, what is the hardest concept you have come upon in Buddhism to believe in or understand?","A question more out of curiosity than anything else. I was raised a Catholic where the concept of the soul is a very big part of the belief system. I did not find it difficult to see the sense of the lack of a creator God like the Abrahamic God is, but the lack of soul in Buddhism is one that I find extremely hard to integrate.

Although not really a soul I do feel like there is a type of essense that connects all of us and that is what I cant seem to let go of"
Buddhism,Is there such a thing as a soul,"So from my understanding (im not necesarrily a buddhist), there isn't necessarily a thing as a soul in buddhism. Yet the buddha said that he remembered his past lives. Which would be different from my past lives. So doesnt that mean there is something such as a soul?  Sorry if this is a stupid question. I have tried to look this up but people explained it in a way that was difficult to understand so if you could explain it somewhat simply  for a non buddhist that would be great thank you."

Now whenever she comes in to my mind I'm not sad, just mad, really really mad. I'm not typically an angry person, but I just feel so cheated. Why would someone get in to a serious relationship for 7 months if they weren't looking for committed? I feel like she used me, and she lead me on for her own pleasure. I feel like she took advantage of my loving nature, and now I'm finding that same nature hard to find. I've fallowed Buddhism on and off for years, I'm hoping it'll be able to help. 

TL;DR I feel like my ex used me and I'm really mad at her. How do I overcome this anger?"
Buddhism,Is marijuana intoxicating?,"I think our initial intuition to this question says, ""Yes, obviously,"" but there's something different about marijuana (and lsd and psilocybin for that matter). The difference is that marijuana is not toxic. 

I think the initial intuition regarding the fifth precept is that we should refrain things that impair our facilities of mind. Now, there is literature which suggests that marijuana impairs short term memory, but maybe we're not seeing the effects of marijuana ""intoxication"" as they really are.

The main point that leads me to wonder that marijuana might not be intoxicating is that marijuana is not toxic. Drugs like alcohol, cocaine, and opiates are commonly used at doses which are about 10% of what is lethal. Those drugs have a poisonous property. Psychedelic drugs however, (with the exception of MDMA and synthetic psychedelic drugs) have virtually no toxicity."
Buddhism,I'm having a worse time showing compassion for others,"I feel a constant background noise. No matter what I do I always comes back, I have a hard time just remaining active and achieving right effort, because no matter what I always convince myself it's not worth it. I've been an addict with food, games, masturbation, and mental stimulation. I think of happy times as though they will never happen again.

I guess it's because I'm still working at this job, a job I've been having nightmares about and such. I feel enormous pressure from peers to family to find a different /better paying job, yet I'm actually content here. It's like I'm being just pushed down on by society for not being good enough, laughed at.

Buddhism,confronting my skepticism towards american buddhists,"i'm in the early stages of exploring buddhism. i try to keep a very basic meditation practice, and as part of that, i enjoy engaging with buddhist scripture and thought from various schools and traditions. to be clear, i am american myself. i find buddhist ideas and practices appealing, and i think it's clearly possible to have an authentic engagement with buddhism as an american...

at the same time, i do not find it easy to accept the authenticity or authority of prominent american buddhists. i understand that someone like bhikkhu bodhi is worthy of respect, for example. but i prefer to turn to other sources to try to learn dharma. 

partly this comes from  an ingrained preference for old texts. i'm somewhat reluctant to accept modern commentary, particularly when it comes from people who were not raised in a buddhist culture. i'm even somewhat reluctant to rely on material from american publishers who focus exclusively on buddhism, as there's a potential ""proselytizing"" aspect. i usually look to the academic press in the first instance, where utility is goal: an accurate translation and a detached presentation of ideas. 

i am wondering if others have confronted these feelings, and if so, what you might have done with them. do you still feel this skepticism to some extent? did you move past it towards a more inclusive perspective? 

this is a fairly long post. thanks to anyone who takes the time to read and reply. "

Buddhism,What Makes a Life Truly Worthwhile? - Bhikkhu Bodhi,
Buddhism,Question about reincarnation,"Does Buddhism believe that the soul chooses its lifetime experiences, for example ""I want to experience being a drug addict and murderer in this incarnation""."
Buddhism,Convince me of free will?,"I don't mean for the title to sound antagonistic. I am trying to put these puzzle pieces together and they're not fitting. I don't understand how there can be free will and no self. Where is this will coming from? Everything you ever do will be from your self. 

Everything you ever think or do is the result of your brain's program which is a result of your past experiences. You are nothing but an inevitable vessel carrying out inevitable actions, no different than a tree that grows and then is blown over in a storm and degrades into the ground again. 

Okay, so we all agree there is no self, and none of your actions are otherwise. So...how is there free will then? 

And even if there is free will...how can it truly be free? The word will implies a goal is involved. In order for there to be a will, there is something the will is willing, which I liken to a goal. So where does this goal come from? You're telling me that one's will could be trying for a goal that is not based on something that previously happened(just like the self does)? For example, how could a will try for a goal that it does not know that it wants or does not want? If it knows that it wants it or not, then that is the exact same mechanism of the self...a mere program. 

Free will would have to come from a yet unknown and incomprehensible plane. The free will would have to be able to do the opposite of what it wills to do, and doing the opposite could not be the thing it was going to do all along. It would have to be independent of all processes we know of. 

I could accept that. But this is where I get really confused. I read things that equate ""mindful"" decisions to be free will. So if you analyze your life and decide not to drink alcohol, then now your free will is imposing its goals over your self. Umm well I think you can see how that is ridiculous--that is just more of your self wanting to abstain from drinking. This is my self wanting to learn about Buddhism. It will be my self that motivates me to seek a master to learn from. It will be my self that EVER does anything. I have read a bit about Zen and I understood their acts of spontaneity(think student slapping the master in the face suddenly and they both laugh about it and confirm the student knows Zen) as their version of free will. If they could do something spontaneous enough, before the brain has a word, then that is their free will. But now I must disagree with this as well. Surely that spontaneous act originates from the brain, out of instinct, or habit, or genetics. It comes from the program. 

It just doesn't make sense. I appreciate that it doesn't need to make sense. But this skepticism has served me well and kept me a free thinker this far, so I'm not going to stop now. 

Thank you. 

p.s. And this doesn't even start on karma yet! "

I consider myself agnostic, but I've always appreciated the idea of Buddhism - at least from an ignorant perspective, I know little of it.

The non-materialistic, meditative ideal really appeals to me, but I don't know how to have a religion and I don't think I'm capable of believing in a higher power or reincarnation.

I don't say that to be antagonistic, that's not what I'm here for - I want people to be able to guide me, and I read that one of the teachings is to question the teachings. That feels good to me.

How do I start deciding if a more secular Buddhism is for me, and I don't in fact just want to learn to meditate? What I want out of it is to find some confidence and peace - I've been struggling with feeling like an impostor and a lack of motivation that I'm starting towards wanting to work through."

Buddhism,Being Buddhist without searching for enlightenment in this life?,"This is a question mainly out of curiosity... sorry for my ignorance, as I know very little about Buddhism. 

Could one be truly Buddhist without trying to reach nirvana in this life?  Say someone feels that this life may not be one in which they can or should reach enlightenment.  

I’m not entirely sure if this question is even relevant to anything.  But, I would love to hear some of you try to answer it. "
Buddhism,Every vehicle is Buddha,"When I drive, I think 'Every one of these vehicles is a Buddha'. Everyone is acting out of great compassion for me. If they do something unexpected, it's to test if I was paying attention. If they behave angrily, I can see if I had anger in me because it is only then that anger appears. If they behave selfishly, I can recognize that and act accordingly. I can see how they drive, kind or harsh.

Every pedestrian is also a Buddha, as is every cyclist, motorcycle and big truck. Every sentient being involved in this performance is a Buddha.

When I see a lot of cars and people, I see a field of Buddhas. They are all here, manifest for my own benefit.

Thank you, Buddhas!

Buddhism,How to approach aversion?,"Hello all. I have been interested in Buddhism for some time but my knowledge is still pretty basic. I read Buddhism for Dummies and watched some Youtube videos but that has been it. One thing that I find easy to understand is the idea that attachment *to the things we enjoy* can cause suffering. However, I have recently started paying more attention to aversion and it equally makes sense that aversion *to the things we don't enjoy* can also cause suffering. 

The problem for me is that attachment is easier to deal with than aversion. I am pretty simple and easy going so detachment is easier to practice. I have a hard time, however, approaching things to which I am averse, like physical labor or social interaction (I'm an introvert). Does anyone have any insights into how to deal with aversion?"
Buddhism,How is Pure-Land Buddhism any different from Christianity?,"Something has been bothering me recently about this particular tradition. Many Buddhist like to expound that Buddhism is more of a philosophy of life than a religion. But it seems to me that the largest sect in Asia is based on the same superstitions that Christianity is. That by chanting Amitābha's name (praying to God) you will be reincarnated (reborn) into the Pure-Land (heaven). How is this any different, more valuable, or more accurate than Christianity? Or any of the other Abrahamic religions for that matter."

Buddhism,Exploring non-self in romantic relationship,"My girlfriend is currently suffering with anxiety, depression and quite possibly bipolar disorder. It's been a stressful year balancing her mental health with my life as well. I've been able to be compassionate for most of the time realizing that none of her attacks are personal towards me but rather a manifestation of her illness. Last night I reached a breaking point though. I had to let her know how I felt and told her she can't keep taking advantage of my compassion by not taking charge of her mental health. I'm not sure if this was the mindful approach. I thought more on this and wanted to see if the non-self ideals would help here. I had the analogy of her attacks on me as if I was a punching bag in a gym. But then I realized if there is truly no self, then she is actually just punching a bag with my face printed on it. I'm not even in the gym. I'm not in any space. Please let me know your thoughts on my thinking. Be well. "
Buddhism,Practicing with Illness,"ÝHi. I thought I'd ask some advice as I am trying to live much more in line with the dharma. I am chronically ill so feel too limited to go the full way of a retreat, or even close.  For me it's about pouring all the energy that I do have towards the dharma, however much that is on any given day. 

I've been studying Buddhism for four years, and lately I've found my interest growing to the point where living the dharma has become my biggest focus. Upon realising romantic and sexual interest to be the biggest distraction to the work I desire to do, I resolved, quite happily, to be celibate.

 I don't work due to my sickness but I've been volunteering a lot recently, as part of my practice which the local geshe suggested to me. I live in an intentional community and mix connecting with others in a caring way with plenty of solitude. 

During my time alone, I spend a lot of time contemplating things such as impermanence, reciting mantras etc. I meditate for short periods of time that brain fog ( illness related ) allows. I have not taken on a teacher formally, but I am getting to know a Geshe through the local sangha. I attend (online ) the three weekly classes he offers

. Anyway, my biggest difficulty is knowing how far to go with avoiding sensuality in every day life. The focus of my practice is compassion. I've been terrible with people sometimes and I'm aiming to treat them more kindly. I'm aiming to trest mysrlf more kindly.  I don't live near my family or most of my friends so I spend quite a big amount time on social media trying to keep up with them, care about them  and stay involved in their lives. That's part of my compassion practice, but obviously too much, or any, social media does not calm the brain. 

I sometimes feel like I'm too harsh on myself by not listening to music or watching movies/Tv, reading fiction. But these things feel like real distractions to me, covering up what's underneath. I am really trying to get to know myself. Sometimes I give in though, if 'm having a particularly distressing or painful day. I don't know if this is compassionate or  covering up issues when I could most benefit from facing them. But on the opposite side, if I don't use any entertainment or social media, I tend to just burn out. 

The other thing is, I lay around a lot. I have to cos I'm sick. I spend at least half my day on the couch. I don't wake up at the same time each day because if I sleep for 11 hours with this illness, that's a good thing. But none of that really does much for disciplining the mind.

So you could say that I'm a full time practitioner in a way, because everything I do is in line with that. But obviously I can't do even a quarter of what your usual dharma practitioner would do in terms of meditation and practice. But since dedicating myself to practice and eliminating /cutting down some distractions, I really do feel that I am slowly gaining deeper understanding of the path and becoming a tiny bit more caring. So it feels worth it to make these sacrifices because I'm doing what is important  (to me)

I am living with an illness that completely motivates me to do what I can. It has made me not take life for granted. As a consequence, I can't bear to waste a moment on things thst don't lead to true happiness for myself and others.  I feel frustrated that I do have to spend so much time pandering to my illness, but then my illness is the reason I began practicing with greater motivation. 

 it's a tug of war about tryjng to be patient with my illness too, and also worrying thst if I go too far down the route of eliminating sensuality, I'll alienate the people in my life. 

I am just seeking some input on anything I've written in this post. I don't think the Geshe reslly understands that I have a chronic illness, or rather, the implications. I'm still building the relationship with him and if he can understand, I'm sure he'll be able to offer some specific advice too in terms of my practice. I think it's good to get people's perspectives here.

Buddhism,Should pedophiles and criminals be treated equally ?,"I recently had a conversation that turned into an argument about equality, and how i feel that criminals, and pedophiles are just as equal to us, and we should not shun them because of what they've done.

We should treat the common man with respect, and maintain our level of love, and compassion for all sentient beings. The criminal feels suffering just as much as we feel suffering; why do we cling on to duality ? Why can't we spread our love for all unconditionally ?

Most people want to kill pedophiles ? by killing them don't we take on their karma ? What justice, or happiness does that give to us ?

**The main question is, what would buddhism say about a topic similar to this ?**

Excerpt From: Deepak Chopra. “Buddha.”

*""I can only stop a moment,” Buddha said. “But if you want my help, come to me.”*

*He turned his back on Angulimala and began slowly walking away. Behind him there was a scream of rage. One thing the old Brahmin had said was true: Angulimala possessed enough demonic energy that he could outrun a horse. He charged at Buddha, his knife stretched out in front like a spear. It should have taken only a few seconds to reach his prey, but Buddha remained a step ahead. Angulimala sped up, panting as he ran. His bare feet stirred up a cloud of dust, but he couldn’t close the gap between himself and Buddha. This kept up for ten minutes, until the wild man fell to the ground, clutching at his cramped legs. Buddha turned around and regarded him.*

*“There’s a small distance between you and me,” he said mildly. “Shall I close it? I can.”*

*“He reached down and touched the killer’s matted hair, and Angulimala began to weep. “Please tell me your real name,” Buddha urged. There was a pause, and Angulimala shivered from head to toe. “Why?” he moaned. By this he meant, Why should anyone help me? I am damned.*

*“I will tell you, but I can’t explain to an animal,” said Buddha.*

*Angulimala clutched at himself, writhing on the ground. Buddha stood quietly, letting the demonic energy drain away. It would take more than a single seizure to purify the wild man, but this was a beginning. After he had thrashed in the dust for some minutes, a name came out. “Anigha,” he said.*

*“Look at me, Anigha,” Buddha said. “We are brothers.”*

Buddhism,Buddhistdoor View: Netizen Nastiness,
Buddhism,please guide me: what wishes to give up and what wishes to fulfill?,"like whishes. they are so paradox. the very core of the teachings seems to be to transcend wishes. yet, this too is a whish. teachings.

i was born and live in northern germany, and i did not have any education in eastern philosophy beside from what one picks up on the fly. i try to learn as much as possible, but my insights are very limited. i am searching for a teacher right now and i do think im blessed to live in the city i do live in. there is a tibetian center here and a tibetan abbot is living there 10 month of the year. in the future i will try to bring up the money to study buddhism there. but right now, i do only have my mind and what i can figure out on my own. i feel i understand a lot by contemplation, but there are some things that puzzle me. 

the one thing that has me puzzled very deeply right now is wishing. wishes are so paradox. the very core of the teachings seems to be to transcend wishes. yet, this too is a wish. so obviously the meaning can not be to give up all wishes. some wishes then must be fulfilled i think.

now, this is where it gets really difficult for. how can i gain the wisdom to see what wishes  i need to fulfill and what wishes i should give up? sometimes its easy enough. my glasses are broken, i need new ones. i need to fulfill this wish, because if i do not do this, i cant be my best self because i cant really make out faces beyond a few meters.

but it is not always that easy!

like, until very recently i was sure i did not want children or even have a lasting relation. i thought i was a toxic person anyhow, and i did not want to force anyone into knowing me very intimately, especially not kids. this had changed. i felt i could be a great influence if i tried, and i did realize i wanted both children and a lasting relation. however, if the goal is to love everybody equally (and i want this very much), how can i be in a relation? i could not give an individual person the feeling of being special then. this must be traumatic, especially for kids. and so here is one wish that i can not fulfill without giving up another, and its quite hard to see what is wise.

should i wish to have a new bicycle? i do not really need it, i can get around with public transportation and by foot easy enough. this too is very borderline. on the one hand, something that might enable me to be more productive, on the other hand possession i can live without.

now, these are just a few examples to make my point. anyone could come up with millions of similar questions. i am NOT asking to have these specific questions answered.

but i am very much interested if my realizations are of any value. if they are of no value, where is my mistake? maybe i am just making it to complicated and it really is very easy. in case some of what i was thinking is true, is there a shortcut? mind tricks or simple methods to use to determine what to give up and what to fulfill?

if someone would share some insight with me i was very very grateful.

thank you ♥

Buddhism,Constant absorption as a way to avoid defilements.,"I spent about a year at home retreat, during which I ate the same meals every day within a short feeding window, avoided all sensual pleasures, had no direct contact with people, and of course maintained strict celibacy.

This was actually fairly easy to do in seclusion.

However, after recently ending the retreat and returning to society, life got a lot tougher.

My workplace overflows with delicious free food and sweets. The pressures of work knocked me off balance and made such gross pleasures extremely hard to resist. I started to think that since I try to live like a monk, the right course would be to permanently abandon laity and live out this life in a monastery, which would be easier, like a permanent retreat.

However, I was concerned I'd be bored to death.

Recently a different solution emerged.

I find that if I can just get completely absorbed in my work, my mental state becomes very wholesome and pure. I am tempted by nothing, and in fact feel joyful, energetic, mindful, and equanimous.

The key is to become completely absorbed. Outside distractions don't matter, they can't really disrupt my concentration. The only effective disruptions come from within me - e.g. an overwhelming urge to get back to a state of agitated, scattered distraction (monkey mind).

Anything on the outside, such as external stimuli, only has the power I grant it. So for example a noisy co-worker can't disrupt my concentration; only I can disrupt my own concentration by thinking I must be distracted due to his noise, which ripens into resentment towards his ""interruption"", effectively succumbing to an attachment to conditioned phenomena.

What's actually happening here is:

My internal defilement reaches out to anchor in an external stimuli, then leverages its apparent reality to overwhelm my concentration with cognitive notions of empty phenomena and defiled thought.

If I avoid this for long enough, I land in a sort of plateau of concentration that feels great and is rather easy to maintain. In that state, I feel no aversion to any task. I can read the same document again and again, or go through the same mundane task, without getting bored (typically a huge problem for me), distracted, ""tired"" (detached, disengaged), or resentful. Wholesome pleasures - such as from getting absorbed in a tough intellectual problem and finding a breakthrough - are enhanced, felt more acutely. Perception in general is sharper. There's a sense of constancy, that you cannot be moved or shaken by contact. Petty discomforts that would normally unbalance you - no longer matter. Gross temptations and unwholesome appeals lose strength because their attractions pale in comparison. Discipline is effortless, since you are joyful and no course of action is resisted or resented.

It's actually somewhat hard to get out of this state. 

One reason this state is easy to maintain is that I clearly perceive any encroaching defilement. My mind has become clear as pure water, and the dark stain of pollution is easily recognized: ""that's aversion approaching... that's greed... that's lust..."". And then I just balance out of it. The key thing is to just let go of these attachments, which is easy when you clearly see and distinguish them.

Once you spend enough time in an undefiled state, you will become highly mindful of defilements, keenly aware of unwholesome states. It's like living on a terrible diet of excessive junk food. Only once you detoxify on a sustained healthy diet, you will realize that before, you were always slightly sick, slightly nauseous. It just seemed like the normal state of being. Now, even if you eat just one large serving of icecream, you will be able to feel yourself getting slightly sick with the sugar overflow, slightly nauseous. Before, you were constantly nauseous like this, worse in fact, but you never noticed because it seemed **normal**.

Another interesting thing is that I noticed there are some forces in me actively working against establishment in this state, or making any progress in general. Like some sort of instinct or inclination to avoid letting go, and specifically the avoidance of deeply concentrated and mindful states.

It's like the ""monkey mind"" isn't just random and silly, but on the contrary manifests some profound and steady force working against further enlightenment.

It can be a real fight. For example, one way these instincts operated: I would find my breath subconsciously disrupted, typically stopped. This would put my body in a state of heightened anxiety. Now I consciously check and regulate my breathing to aid concentration.

Anyway, just thought I would share, and certainly would love to read your comments."
Buddhism,Advice for someone considering moving to Thailand and ordaining as a monk?,"I've been on many retreats and have been a Buddhist for around 4 years now.

I find this very strange as in Buddhist countries it is one of the most auspicious activities a devoted practioner can take part in.

~

About 5 years ago, I was pretty depressed and decided to do research on happiness. A lot of what I read led me to meditation, so I decided to look up Buddhism since I know that's something that is deeply integrated in the religion.

I had an extremely rough childhood where I was under constant physical and mental abuse, surrounded by drugs and alcohol. Eventually, I moved out to my uncle's who is a great friend, but that relationship devolved over the years and became constant fighting which eventually included physicality too. He can be a very petty guy. At the time, I must admit, I was too. We would have fights where I spent hours trying to prove that I was right when we both didn't care at all what we were arguing about.

But anyway, back to Buddhism. I learned about letting go of desires as they lead to selfishness and disappointment. I took this very seriously as it all clicked in my head that a common cause of my problems was desire. I stopped fighting with my uncle as I no longer desired to be right.

Now, the thing is, fighting with my uncle was the worst thing in my life at the time. I love him greatly as my savior, my guardian and my friend. I couldn't bear the constant fighting we had. When I found peace with him, I extended this to the rest of my life and desires. I found myself getting less and less upset at things. I became quite calm for once in my life. Laid back and not overtly sensitive to things going slightly askew.

But... over the years.... this has led me to feel empty. Soulless. Lifeless. Yes, I don't feel the immense amount of pain like I used to, but I also don't feel joy either. I'm numb.

I've always made art my entire life. Drawings, videos, sculptures, animations, etc. I had tons of ideas and I would actually make them.

I'm professionally an animator now. When given a task I can do it because I've been told what to do. When I try and create something for myself... Nothing. Because I don't have anything I want to make.

I feel like my imagination is broken. I feel like I have nothing to express or share. I have tried mind maps, writing down random ideas that branch off one another and other similar exercises. I end up with a huge list of things I don't care about.

I've made a few animations off these ideas where I spent months of my life creating something I don't care about. I have published these animations and my viewers can feel the lifelessness of it. I'm not a huge YouTuber, but my videos years ago would average a few thousand. As I began giving up my desires, my videos have become more and more soulless and my viewership has died as the videos have no heart.

(Please don't get me wrong. I'm not complaining about viewership. Just trying to provide an example of how my heartlessness can be measured).

~

#**In summary:**
Letting go of my desires has made me feel a lot less pain, but also a lot less joy. I feel empty and soulless.

Buddhism,“...and these memories lose their meaning when I think of love as something new.”,"No matter what happens to you: what your life was and is like, what you have to deal with, it’s always gonna be okay if you trust yourself and love yourself, and learn to be fully content with just spending time with yourself. Knowing your weaknesses and loving them, knowing your strengths and loving them, knowing your limits and loving them.

Trust is extremely important too. Life, the universe, and all of the unfashionable possibilities of nature that seem impossible to grasp can become overwhelming and scary for many of us. There’s no reason to deny this. But we don’t need to torture ourselves with FIGURING IT ALL OUT. So what if we do? Even enlightenment can be a desire that sends us in the opposite direction of where it really is. All we need to do is to trust the universe and trust ourselves. It’s not easy. We might not be comfortable just leaving the seemingly most “important” things in existence to trust. But that’s all we need to do. Trust the process.

When you find yourself caught in a cycle of questions about the universe and life, remember love and trust. There’s no need to dig for answers. There’s no need to wrap our minds around anything. All we need to do is to love everything about our experience. We need to see our reaction to things and love them. Instead of diving deep into the questions of everything, all we need to do is look down into that bottomless ocean and love it. We can look up from this too to see the clear sky, the place where there is no need for questions. We can love this too. And we can look at our own perspective of these things. We can love that too.

Naturally, we need to show the same love that we share with ourselves with the people in our lives as well. Do we really want to spend our lives just having problems with the people we come across?

The reason I put this quote (a lyric from “In My Life” by The Beatles) in the title is because there’s no moment where love is inaccessible. Despite our memories and experiences, both good and bad, these lose their meaning when we choose to love the present. When we lose the insatiable need to answer questions and to even ask questions. When we lose our fear of the future. Just accept who you are, where you are now, and who you are with. It’s simple.

The only other thing I can say is please don’t over-analyze this post. Just read it. Don’t try to shove it into your life. Don’t force it. Trust the process. Trust that where you are now is where you need to be. I promise you’ll find love. We all will."

Buddhism,Help with prayer beads,"So I am not a Buddhist, but my fiancee is. She has a set of prayer beads that she often has with her. She often wears them around her wrist like a bracelet. Unfortunately she's had these for a few years now, and since she uses them all the time, they've gotten a bit worn and she's been talking about buying a new set. So I thought that a new set of prayer beads would be a perfect Christmas gift for her. I'm really not sure where to buy one, so I was hoping you guys could help out.

I know I could probably just search on Amazon or whatever and find some, but I don't imagine that the first thing I find will really be high quality, so I was hoping you guys could help me find something that is high quality for a fair price. Thanks in advance!"
Buddhism,How does Norodha (The truth of the cessation of suffering) differ from encouraging complacency?,"I am teaching Intro to World Religions to grade 11 students. I taught the four noble truths of Buddhism yesterday, and one student stumped me with this question.

If we eliminate attachment and desire in order to end suffering, where do we find motivation to work or do good deeds? If we are seeking success in any field, does that not come from a desire for success?

Are my friends and roommates ""fools"" for having a set of standards for themselves that, although different from mine, don't harm me in the slightest?"

Americans seem constantly angry and out for vengeance, regardless of their beliefs.

Buddhism,"Meditation experience, insight needed","I don't know if this is the correct subreddit to post this in but I didn't get any responses in the 'meditation' subreddit...

12 days ago I attempted my first deep meditation/hyponosis 'experience'. I have mediated only a few time in the past but never experienced anything like I did this past time. Within about 5 minutes my body had the most odd sensation and it is almost impossible to describe in words so stick with me... My body felt like it was 1000x larger but incredibly light and I could not tell where my body began or stopped either but it was this sense of incredible expansion. Then there is this feeling on my front torso and arms that it feels like this massive sphere is on my body, but it isnt heavy, it's actually weightless in a way but i can feel my body somewhat wrapping to the cirvlinar lines of this large but formless sphere... (this is really hard to decribe well because each sensation contradicts each other some how?!)

Lastly, even though i felt incredibly relaxed and calm, my heart was pounding out of my chest during this experience. I did not feel anxious but it was pounding like I had just sprinted a mile. Is this normal while mediating? I only post this inquiry in this subreddit as from what I know Buddhism is deeply involved in meditation practices.

Has anyone else here ever experienced this or heard of anything similar? Any insight is greatly appreciated, thank you."

Buddhism,Sending you guys the text of an email I sent. What do you think?,"To whom it may concern:

My name is X. I am Jewish, but I practiced at the Fo Guang Shan temple in Y for a period of several months. I was drawn to Buddhism because Shakyamuni Buddha's teachings of compassion, and the ethics of Fo Guang Shan, really assisted me in a time when I was not doing so well. In addition, I was not really connected to Jewish teachings at the time, so that was a factor as well. I had registered to take Refuge, but I came to an epiphany based on the abbot's lesson during the Refuge class. The Venerables stressed the importance of filial piety and venerating one's ancestors. My ancestors were Jewish, and there are people alive in my family today who were persecuted for being Jewish. As a result, I don't feel like I could have observed the Buddha's teachings as Buddhists do, and honor my ancestors. I'm very comfortable in my newly observant Jewish life, but I kind of regret not going through with the Refuge ceremony. Many Buddhist practices (bowing to images of the Buddha, offerings, etc) are not compatible with Jewish practice, but most of Buddhist ethics and all of the Noble Eightfold Path are indeed compatible. Is there any way I can reconcile these two streams of thought? In addition, I feel somewhat bad that I left the Y temple abruptly. I emailed them explaining my reasons, but I still feel mildly guilty about it. Is this a reasonable feeling?

I finally got approval for a school sponsored Sangha in a town with no Buddhist service, so it's going to be cool. We are not specified as one form of Buddhism or another, so this question is really for anyone. I was wondering if you all had suggestions for texts (especially), meditation materials (i.e. pillows). Just stuff that will make this a safe and welcoming environment for students, we have a lot of new people coming into it interested with the Dharma and want to make sure their experience is safe. 

I will be donating my personal collection of text: Freedom in Exile (Dalai Lama), Buddhism (Smith &amp; Novak), Siddartha (Hesse), Being Peace (Thich Nhat Hanh), The Great Awakening (Loy), eehh I am blanking on the rest. A copy of the Dharmapada. Book of the Dead.
I was also gifted the Sangha Starter kit by the Thich Nhat Hanh foundation, so that was so nice and I am grateful. We have a singing bowl, a few collection of lectures on tape, Happiness, The Mindfulness Survival Kit &amp; Joyfully Together. 
texts &amp; really anything you think would be good would be helpful, I am zen Buddhist who steers closer to the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh and Roshi Joan Halifax, so my collection is pretty centered on that, but we have Buddhist students from many sects and I want to ensure that have access to those resources. I also don't want anyone to feel I am forcing them to follow my path in the tradition, or that Zen Buddhism is exclusively welcomed in the space. I want them to find a path that works for them, if this is right for them. I also want to some meditation practices and half-day retreats for everyone in the community (of course lead by a Dharma leader in the closets biggest city).  

Also suggestions on activities would be cool! 

Thank you all so much in advance.

Buddhism,How to React to Harm in Accordance with the Dharma," In Bodhicharyavatara it is mentioned that “in the past, I gave such harm to other sentient beings, therefore sentient beings harming me is worthwhile. It is worthwhile for me to receive this harm.”

When others are harming you—even fleas biting you, even a mosquito biting you, ants biting you, bees stinging, others getting angry at you, abusing you—you see that whatever happens, there is always a reason. The reason is you harmed others first. So you can understand, by remembering why it happens, remember the reason, so then you can think, “It is worthwhile that I received [the harm].”

Usually what we do is think, “I’m perfect, the most perfect, never wrong, others are wrong.” You blame others. Then somebody harms, abuses you, somebody looks at you bad, somebody says something bad, and you harm back, you crush them, you disintegrate them, whatever you can do, immediately. It is like this. “There is nothing wrong me. I’m perfect. Others are wrong.” …

This is not an educated person’s action. It is not an educated person’s personality. No, [it is the action of] an uneducated person, same as a tiger, a dog; if somebody harms you, then you bite back, the same. Somebody harms you, so you harm back. That is animal character. You understand? It is not wise. But this is how normally we do.

The reason [you receive harm] is that in the past you cheated or you abused others in that way. You abused others in that way, so then this time it happens to you. This person, why this person abuses you? Why? It is because in the past you abused this person in that way. Even if a flea is biting you, it is the same. So everything is the same.

So the great bodhisattva Shantideva said, “It is worthwhile that I receive harm from others this time.” It is worthwhile.

Then, it is mentioned, “My karma persuaded, then I received this harm. By that, didn’t I lose that sentient being in the hole of the hell?”

So, it means in the past you gave harm. Then because of that, your karma persuaded the person, and the result is that that person is harming you. That happens from that cause—you harmed the person in the past so in this life you are harmed by this person.

Now the person harming you is in the human world. But because of that harm, it makes the person not be in the human realm in the future but to reincarnate and fall down into the hole of the hell, the hell realm.

Thinking of that is a way of generating compassion. Instead of getting angry and harming back, you generate compassion, the root of happiness for yourself and all sentient beings. To generate compassion back is very important.

Generate compassion. When other sentient beings abuse you, whatever harm they do to you, use that to generate compassion.

Buddhism,Radical Acceptance- Embracing your life with the heart of Buddha,"I’ve just finished this book and it’s really helped me with accepting life as is and the whole concept of impermanence. I have always struggled with the need to control my life and I do not know how to let go even when I know I have to. 

Since I started reading this book I’ve had a recurring dream. In the dream I am watching a person recite something I originally thought was a prayer but it eventually came together as a poem.  Every dream had a piece of the poem so I pieced it together as best I could. 

The dream is hard to have because this person was dear to me and is no longer in my life. I’m hoping now that the poem feels complete the dream will no longer occur. 

Thank you for letting me share. 


Let the light shine through you.   
Be open to receive it. Open your heart and soul to let it in.     
Embrace that light in all of who you are.             
But as well as you embrace it and take it in, make sure you let it go.              
Let it pass through you because that is what this life is about.           
It is about taking it in, feeling it and moving it through you.         
Because you let it go doesn’t mean you can’t still feel it’s warmth and shine.          
It doesn’t mean that the love is lost or that your soul isn’t still imprinted on mine.         
Feel it when you need it but don’t hold on, you must let go.          
As you let the light shine through you, I will do the same for me.         
I will feel the light, I will take it in because just like you I need it.         
I need it to fill my heart and soul because at times it feels dark.        
But as I take the light in and it passes through me I release a little bit of the darkness.       
We can’t feel the light together, we can’t share what the light is doing nor can we encourage each other to be open.       
But just because we can’t experience it together doesn’t mean we shut it out.         
So please remember to always let the light in and trust that I will do the same forever.

Buddhism,I doubted the Dharma.,"I am a relatively new practitioner; I've been practicing for about 2 years now. But contrary to many people new to Buddhism, I have been practicing within the cloister of a Zen Monastery for the entirety of that time. The practice here is intense.. I've done more than 20 week long sesshins, a number of zazenkais and I am a formal student of the order. The growth and maturity I've experience these past two years have been immeasurable and so valuable..

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I truly doubted the practice for the first time.

&amp;#x200B;

I've felt a strong calling towards Monasticism for a large part of my life, even early in my life when I did not have a real relationship to Buddhism. It's something that I've truly believed would be a life worth living, looking deeply into the reality of things and offering my life in service of others seeking the path. Excluding the details of the events that played a part in my doubt, I've begun questioning if dedicating my life entirely to the three Treasures is actually worth it. ( I really did not want to use the word ""worth"" but I am lacking a better way to articulate ).

&amp;#x200B;

I am at this pivotal point in my practice where the way I've been practicing isn't necessarily working anymore. And its not because I've been practicing ""wrong"" or half-ass; Its just that on a fundamental level, I've been doing things the way I always have.  That the progress I've been experiencing is really just the entry into the deep well of Buddha-Dharma, and a deeper shift in the way I interact and relate to my experience needs to unfold.

&amp;#x200B;

I've doubted if this is actually real.. If its actually worth the struggle and work. Which is crazy to consider because it completely has been up to this point. But like.. am I just fooling myself..? Is this just some kind of brainwash.. How deep does this really go.. Am I tricking myself into detaching from the narrative of things and just experiencing directly.. In the beginning of my sitting practice I totally was repressing for sometime but now  I am very aware (at least on the level I am) of when I am repressing or legitimately letting go. But what is experiencing directly exactly? What does that look like in relative reality.. How is the absolute relative, and relative the absolute..

&amp;#x200B;

This was a very emotional experience. I was sobbing in the middle of the zendo ( again =p ).. But in the bottom of my heart I felt the Dharma was real, it is true. But my mind still wants to doubt it.. Oh Mara

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I am just rambling now but my whole idea of what being a realized being is, what enlightenment is, of what practice is has been shaken. Which is really a healthy thing, I know that my idea of what these things are, is not the reality of them but still... Is it worth giving up the world to dive deeply into this...

&amp;#x200B;"
Buddhism,"I am extremely depressed, greedy, lonely, lustful, resentful. Is there anyone like me who has been cured through Buddhism?","I have been hurting lately. I hurt because of the things that I don't have. I feel alone. No friends or girlfriend. Socially stunted and isolated. Unable to connect with others. Avoidance of social situations. Extreme resentment of certain people. 

I hurt so I find means of escapism. Marijuana. Social Media. Porn. Video games. Escorts. These things make me feel happy for a short time, only to feel even worse later on. 

Buddhism is appealing, because buddhism tells me that I'm just sick and crazy but I can be cured if I follow the path.

I have a hard time finding the discipline to follow the path. I have a hard time meditating, even if it's just keeping a commitment of a couple minutes a day. I have a hard time feeling altruistic towards others. I don't even feel compassion towards myself. I don't ever feel like giving my hard earned money to others, I feel too attached to it. I have a hard time connecting with the more dogmatic aspects of buddhism, in fact it kind of leaves a bad taste because I've never been a big fan of religion. 

But I'm desperate, and I always come back to idealizing buddhism. I always keep thinking that this will how I could end my suffering.

Has anyone been like me, and was cured by buddhism?"
Buddhism,TIL: there is a german matchmaking agency where 47% of the members relate to buddhism,"So i want to find new friends an a new love. searching the internet for help i stumbled over this dating agency that has a very strong focuss on taking into account specialities and quirks of the members, like disabilities, eating habbits, unusual family planning, relegious believes and whatnot.

what i find most interesting is that among the users of this agency 47% say they are interested in or study buddhism, with christianiy ranking second at 39% (though both can be selected at the same time). it is especially noteworthy because germany, with a population of roughly 80 millions, has only an estimated 250.000 active buddhists.

another interesting thing about this site is the pricing model. the normal price is 94€ per year, but anyone can pick a reduced rate for people with low income at 69€.  however, they also offer membership at 6€! per year, if one writes an email to the administrators and explains that one is so poor that the reduced rate still can not be afforded.

now, you might think: eh, to special, to small, wont work. but: its actually not that small  with 19000 active members, and it has a comparably very high success rate.

i just wanted to share this with you, because i think its a great thing to  know about and because it might help someone else looking for the same things i do.

i am unsure if i should write out the name of the agency here. i do not want to appear as if i would want to do a promotion for this service. if you are interested, just ask within the comments and i will tell you the name.

Buddhism,Why was Gautama Buddha reluctant to ordain women?,"Did he try to limit the influence of desire inside his sangha? Was it because the first of his disciples were men, and were it otherwise (he would have started teaching women first), he would be reluctant to ordain men the same way?

&amp;#x200B;

If enlightenment provides one with limitless wisdom, couldn't he have found a way right there and then, to counter this problem?

If he was reluctant, he must have had some idea of why that is. Some doubts about positive outcome. Does that mean attaining Nirvana does not directly correlate to being doubt-free?"

Buddhism,How to practice Buddhism?,"Hello all,

I am new to Buddhism. After growing up catholic and being anti-religion for years I decided to embrace my spiritual side that was always there. I made the recognition religion and spirituality are separate things. 

Then I started learning about Buddhism, the four noble truths and eightfold path. I learned of the history of the Buddha. I agree with everything I am learning. My question is, how do I actually practice Buddhism? 

I currently meditate a few times a week (although short still I haven’t been able to transcend deep into meditating because sitting for ten minutes is still hard for me.)

I do yoga a few times a week as well. But there is more to it than that. I live in one of the biggest cities In The country and there are temples near me, but honestly it’s intimidating.

The closest one to my house is Vietnamese and I haven’t actually gone but their website has all these words I don’t know, haha I know it sounds dumb. But it’s like entering a whole new culture I know nothing about. Like what’s a Abidhamma class? What’s a weekly Dhamma  Deshana? Daily Buddha Puja? Lol 
I’m white and I don’t really fit in with this culture, but it’s interesting to me.

I’ve also gone to a couple of meditation meetups but they’ve been... odd to say the least.  One of the meetups had huge roaches on the walls and I absolutely could not relax to meditate, lol. 

I guess I just need to keep searching? Or get brave enough to go to a temple. 

Anyone have anything they can share about their practice in Buddhism? Anything you do, anywhere you go? Any good books to read?


Thank  you!!!"
Buddhism,Pleasure,Buddhism talks an awful lot about suffering. What does it teach about pleasure?
Buddhism,Nowhere to go,"Hello r/Buddhism. When I was in my teens I was fueled by worldly attractions (power, money, lust etc.). Needless to say this never led me to fulfillment however I still was moving around jobs and felt like I was getting somewhere. Then my trip turned towards the spiritual side of things. I have been reading tons, listening to lectures, and meditating daily. I'd even go on bursts of exercising and eating healthy. I was feeling better bit by bit. Recently I had a realization that there is nothing 'I' can do to get rid of 'myself'. Great right this is a great mystical realization. Wrong. I have no motivation to go anywhere anymore there's no goodie out there for 'me' to get. Yet the identification to the mind still persists. I'm lost and tired with no where to go."
Buddhism,Need advice please,"I have become deeply disturbed by the suffering that exists in the world and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

(Quick background) I grew up very religious in the Christian faith. I no longer subscribe to any religion, but I find Buddhism a million times more humanistic and a much better philosophy towards life than Christianity.

&amp;#x200B;

I no longer know whether or not a god exists, but if one does, I am deeply saddened by the amount of animal/human suffering in the world and the lack of any intervention by any possible god. So either there is no god or there is a god, but they do not care/intervene in anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I need help with is this:

How do I cope knowing there is so much suffering in the world?

How can I stay happy and positive when some person or some animal is suffering?

What can I personally do to alleviate suffering?

If there is a god, why do they allow this to happen?

&amp;#x200B;

How could a god allow things like the holocaust or wild animal suffering/torture by other humans?"
Buddhism,How to chant?,"What I do — I have been chanting early in the morning after waking up for about 60-75 minutes before I meditate. It’s either the last portion of the Hridaya Sutra or Om Mani Padme Hum. 

Why I do it — I understand the meaning of the words and constant repetition helps reaffirm my motivation and also sharpen my focus.

The doubt — I came across a passage from the Ghitassara Sutta where the Buddha explains the 5 drawbacks of reciting with a musical intonation. I have, over the days, settled into a particular way of recital and am wondering what I should do about it. Should I give up chanting?"
Buddhism,Saying from Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche,"In this age of materialism, people suffer from alienation and lack of purpose, and many people are seeking for something more. When there is so much seeking, there is a danger that a path specially designed to relieve temporal pain might come to overshadow the real path that uproots suffering, the true path to enlightenment.

Interest in dharma is scarce to begin with, and even then, such interest is very fickle. And if we were to encounter a path that did not have the view, we would become even more disillusioned. This would be very sad, because there is genuine seeking. Without the view, the whole purpose of Buddhism is lost. It is then no longer Buddhism – a path to enlightenment – but merely a method for temporal healing.

So, even for the sake of insurance, at least some of us should pay some attention to establishing the view.

Buddhism,Question about a monk who goes by Cau Chin (uncle 9),"   
Long post saying sorry ahead of time


Hello, I recently got into Buddhism.  From 29 til now I have been going through such a rough time in my life.  I have no direction in life.  No solid career to help me support my 2 sons (6 and 4).  I am a single father and was devastated when my ex left us for another man.  I was a wreck for a good 6 months.  I found peace through Buddhist teaching and through the peace I was slowly able to get my life on track.

  I started to work at a company with fellow Vietnamese people that are Buddhist.  I took the Buddhist teaching serious I even became a vegetarian to prove my faith.  Anywho, a coworker of mine referred me to see Cau Chin a famous monk in Houston TX.    After work last Monday I went to go see him with a coworker.  He’s famous for his fortune telling (coi boi).  I don’t believe in fortune telling.  I decided to go anyways to see the temple.  To my surprise it is a beautiful temple with a lot of ethnicity.  Mexican, blacks, Asians, white, etc.

I walked into the temple as there were people in attendance and Cau Chin was doing his Buddhist chants (sorry if it’s not a chant I’m fairly new to Buddhism).  After he finished he walked into the room and I walked to  Quan  The Am Bo Tat statue to show my respects.  Got on my knees and bowed down 2 times I was suppose to do 3.  As I was about to bow down for the third time I felt someone tap my right shoulder and ask me in Vietnamese “what is your sign) I was confused because when Vietnamese people see me they think I’m Filipino or Mexican 99% of the time.  So he repeated himself as I looked confused and I told him in Vietnamese “dragon” he said “88, this is a tough year for you and every step you take forward you take 3 step back.  You’re sad and have no direction in life.  Soon it will all work out as long as you keep faith in Buddha.”  He goes on to tell me that I will find love soon so don’t be sad.  Then tells me my ages that I will have good luck.  He talks really fast.  I should have listened to advice from others and record him talking because he talks fast.  


Mind you I have never looked at this man or had eye contact with him.  He hasn’t even looked my way until he saw me bowing down to the Buddha statue.  I don’t know how he saw sadness and struggle from me.  I tend to keep my feelings inside and show no facial expression.  I normally smile and talkative at work.  The last instruction he gave me was bow to Quan  The Am Bo Tat 108 times a day for 2 years.

What is your opinion on Cau Chin if anyone knows about him.  I plan on revisiting his temple and going to other temples to learn more about Buddhism. "
Buddhism,Justified Hatred?,"What is the purpose of this feeling? How can it be useful? In your opinion, is it ever okay to hate? 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate right now. Someone (who I have never met) has disrespected and mistreated someone I love and care about and I hate him. I really hate him for his actions. I hate him because of the false image he puts out into the world - the image of the happy-go-lucky guy who's just friends with everybody - this is not his true behavior. I know how he treats people when no one is watching, and I wish everyone else could know too.

&amp;#x200B;

I know at some point I must learn to forgive this person, who I have never even met, but I feel unable to at this point. I know this hatred is only hurting myself and those around me. I have recently come to Buddhism in order to deal with my anger, and it's helping with that a lot, and even when it comes to discussing hatred, but the feeling itself remains strong.

&amp;#x200B;

I think a lot about that quote that's probably from Mark Twain or something that goes ""Hatred is like drinking poison and expecting your enemy to die.""

&amp;#x200B;

I want to overcome hatred and live a life where I am able to have compassion for everyone, including my enemies, so this feeling of hatred is embarrassing to me. But overcoming this hatred seems difficult for a few reasons, some of which I will list now. 

* I know the fact that I have never met this person might make it easier for me to view him as nothing more than the worst of his actions, thus making it easy to hate him. 
* It is difficult for me to overcome this hatred because I feel I am correct and justified in hating him for his actions. The way he treats people goes completely against what I believe, so my hatred feels ""morally correct"".
* The hatred not only goes outward, but inward. I feel as if there is something that I could have done or said to the one I love to have prevented this situation from happening. I am very angry at myself.
* I will add more reasons as they come to me.

So what do you think? Can hatred ever be justified? And even if it can be, what is the correct way to deal with it?"

Buddhism,"New to Buddhism, looking for a crash course","Hi All,

Through therapy I've been turned on to the ideas of Buddha and mindfulness.  I am excited to be on this journey of self discovery and peace. I'm curious as to what this community has to offer in the way of understanding basic principles and meditative practices, specifically in the realm of a retreat. The idea of going on a retreat is daunting because there seems to be a lot of different types with different intentions. 

I'm looking to discover the absolute basics, in hopes that through that I can choose, not necessarily a clear path, but a direction in which I can take my practice. 

I'm sorry if there's a similar post to this that I've neglected to see. 

Thank you in advance! "
Buddhism,White Lotus (Chinese Subtitles),
Buddhism,"Are new ""souls"" created regularly or is there a static amount created in the start?","hello all,

not sure if this is a silly question or something that has been asked before.

I have a general interest in religions. I like learning about them and talking to those who practice them. 

Buddhism has always been one of the few religions that I feel a personal connection to that I have agreements with.  

I was just pondering on this question this morning.

I understand the concept of cycle of birth and death and your journey. 

are there people born that are ""fresh"" souls and not recycled?   the population on earth keeps growing and growing so I would assume that new souls have to be made?

but what determines if a body is given a recycled soul or a new one etc.

is there anything available in regards to information on this or is it just something to ponder on."
Buddhism,I am tired,"I begin to wonder if the human mind was meant to sustain such a long life-span. In the last century or so, our bodies have learned to grow older but our minds are still primitive as it can be. I am forever a slave to my basic instincts but chipped and chiseled by societal norms. 

I am very successful, in my early 30's, have great material things and have been to many beautiful places. I am not depressed (at least I don't think so) but I wonder if it's worth it to live this out. 

Consider the notion that life is a journey. The destination then, is nothing but death. The discipline of life must be our willingness to ""carry on"", learn to pick ourselves up, face adversity and overcome. Overcome challenges, obstacles, be mindful, be aware and be free...until you die. 

I am most envious of my cat. He poops when he wants, sleeps when he wants, ignores me when he wants but chooses to acknowledge me when I am needed. A cat truly ""lives in the moment"" and as far as I can tell, has very limited capacity for cognitive reasoning. In layman's terms, he truly, truly does not give a fuck and I truly, truly envy that position. 

I am not depressed. At most, I am unhappy. At the very least, I am tired. I'm just tired. I got to go to work tomorrow. I don't hate my job but I don't care for it. Day in and day out, I have to do this dance. And it's really tiresome. I gotta do this for another 50+ years? Sounds tiring.

Buddhism,Hurtful life at home. Making A Decision.,"Greetings.

I have decided that there is no better time than the present i can make this decision and im in need of some outside opinion.

Im 19, live in a relativity small town in the centre of Scotland, i dont know if that information will be useful or not, but my dilemma is this, since the age of around 14/15, and since then it has become a bigger and bigger part of my focus, but i never did much research, i always only understood the basics, and never really got into the teachings, that is until i turned 18 and since then ive been trying to read more and more, and with this, i think i have reach The A&amp;P well i  first got the felling i had reached it around 16 but i never knew what it was, the weird feelings while meditating, the emotions coming out of nowhere, but know im starting to lose where to find things to study, and to continue my growth, although this could be due to me being young and naive, or having not thought through all my possibilities, and yes i know being around the territory of A&amp;P means thoughts could be influenced by cycling.  I can also see arguments based on the three trainings, suggesting that such an abandon of my current life-platter is radically neglecting the training of morality to pursue the other two. In particular, just leaving would upset my parents immensely, but i feel it appropriate to give a quick life summary.

&amp;#x200B;

 I think it is wise to give a short summary of my life up to this point, as these details have led up to my current position. As much as I feel bad about just shooting off a long list of ""problems"" in my life, I feel it necessary to do so in order to show where I'm coming from. I love my parents and my sister, and I'm extremely grateful for the quality of life I live, the food and money provided, and the general comfort of life.  

 Of course, the typical teenager will complain about their parents, but please read this for what it is, rather than as the stereotypical angsty teen complaining. My parents both come from low-income households, where the father was unfaithful and left the wife and kids. and is such in this household, father left when i was 6 and never heard a word again. 

My mum is watching television quite frequently. She doesn't like to be talked to, really. If I try to talk to her while she's watching tv, she'll not look away, give a brief answer, and be obviously annoyed. She'll turn the tv up, and say that she's trying to watch. She gets home from work, changes out of work clothes, turns on the tv, and turns it off when it's time to go to bed. I see her taking all kinds of pills for headaches, aches, sleeping, and all sorts of things. She seems quite healthy to me, but she's constantly talking about what she thinks is wrong with her. I suspect she is a hypochondriac, and I suspect that her medical knowledge from tech school enables her to worry about a vast array of problems she's learned about. She constantly self-diagnoses herself with problems and goes to the doctor, but it seems that her only verified problem is poor eyesight and chronic migraines, of which the doctors don't understand. I attribute it to constant stress and worry. She is always worrying. She will often come into my room at night and ask if I smell something burning. She boards some doors at night for fear of break-ins. We have an alarm system too. She doesn't sleep well. I suspect she only gets 4 hours of sleep or so, and it seems to be extremely light. She has explained how her mind is constantly turning at night, how her worrying keeps her up. She has also expressed depression, which I will get to in a minute. When I talk with her, she talks about her and her boss, how her boss is like her son, how she is always getting compliments, and how much she hates one of her coworkers. She is constantly baking cakes, pies, brownies, and bringing treats to work, but doesn't seem to do these things at home. She has a tendency to unload for a very long period of time without any silent space, and then once she's done, walk away without me having said a word. If I try to tell her about my day, she will distantly say ""uh huh, uh huh"" as she walks away, turns on the tv, or does other things. When she asks me questions, they seem to be an attempt to prove my inadequacy. When I express having had a bad day, having felt poorly, having had a bad experience, she is almost certain to respond with ""You should have..."", making a point of how these things are my fault, some kind of shortcoming of my foresight or emotional strength. If I am to pursue it and explain how it's just an expression of the feelings that are getting to me, she may respond with, ""What am I supposed to do about it? I can't do anything about it"". 

She has blatantly told me that she doesn't trust me or my sister, and often makes outright incorrect claims about knowing we are doing sin. She has been known to literally run suddenly up and down stairs, and ask me, my sister, or my friends if we're doing something we shouldn't be doing. One time, she was pulling in the driveway as she saw me upstairs in the bathroom through the window. I went downstairs and played piano. She had seen me upstairs when she pulled in but then when she found me on the lower level when she came inside, she accused me of doing things I shouldn't be. She has stood outside my bathroom and accused me of masturbating. She has also told us of having, in her words, premonitions where we're drowning or dying somehow. This is not an exaggeration. My take of my mum is this: she grew up in a miserable household, but never learned to trust men, or maybe just humans in general, never learned to love herself, and never learned a set of social skills that I deem vital to raising children.  

 I admit that there is intense resent, but I, honestly, don't express it. I've learned to be very quiet, emotionally detached, and generally absent from the house. I don't try to talk to her anymore. I don't share feelings, concerns, school life, thoughts, daily activities, anything like that, unless there is a compelling need. I'm not cold though. I try to be a good son, since they are providing for me. I try to practice metta. I do the dishes, occasionally buy treats, take out garbage, and do nice things when they weren't asked of me. I say, ""hey, how was your day?"". I ask how I can help. I try to avoid any sort of disagreement, even over simple things, since she seems to lack the ability to discuss differing opinions without raising her voice, claiming that I'm condescending, and telling me not to challenge her.  

I remember being intensely interested in psychic stuff, meditation, enlightenment, and spirituality from at least age of 14  and I have a feeling that I was already cycling through nanas by that point, and it is possible that dark night stuff was involved. I remember feeling desperation, misery, helplessness, agony, hatred towards others and myself, and isolation. However, these fits of horrible feelings would usually lead up to this odd sort of compassion that seemed outside of myself, like a mother weeping over the pain of her child. From this perspective, I felt not only a sense of compassion for myself, but also for my parents and for what pain they must experience. I felt sorry for myself, sorry for them, and guilty for these feelings of compassion for those who I thought were causing me so much pain. I tried to talk to a counselor at school and she just told me that she saw it as a teen rebellion thing, and that if she were in my parents position, she would make me go to church. I gave up at that point, seeing nowhere at all to turn, and tried to kill myself by burning lots of charcoal in my car, while I listened to Chopin and read about his life. I took the missionary fund my parents had been saving for me, cashed it, bought some weed. Two miraculous things happened. One, I smoked a joint, figuring it would be a nice way to ease the stress of dying. Two, my friend skipped class and checked his email randomly, finding a suicide note that I had intended for him to pass on to my parents. Once I smoked that joint, something snapped in my mind. I just suddenly didn't want to die after I smoked it. I've heard similar stories to that effect. Then, my friend called and calmly but intimately implored me to keep living, to step out of the car and start over completely anew. I did that. I didn't tell anyone about this besides the friends who were involved in the phone call. I don't see how it would do any good to tell my seemingly unstable parents about this.  


I rebuilt myself. I learned that I could be my own center of stability. I learned that even in pain, there could be peace. Equanimity, I suppose. I learned the power of emotions, the power of thoughts, the power of attractive thinking, and the value and vulnerability of life. I realized that I wasn't the only one in such a situation of pain. I began to look at others and realize that beneath the facade, there was a mass of unacknowledged pain. I realized that we never really ""have it all together"", that any kind of together-ness was absolutely fictional, even in times of happiness. I saw how new-age stuff was falling short of realizing this imperfect nature, this unavoidable chaos, this unfixable imperfectness in every human. Having dropped to that extremely low point and stepping away into some kind of peace, I realized that even in the midst of the most turbulent pain, one could accept it and find that peace. I realized that I had insight of some kind, but these insights weren't really mature, formulated clearly like this, or well-practiced. But these knowledges were certainly there.

So I've been practicing meditation (jhana and vipassana) for about a year or so. I admit that it isn't a long time. However, I have the ability to enter (soft jhanas) 1-4, and seem to be able to get up to equanimity in insight meditation. I believe I crossed the A&amp;P long, long ago, since I've been obsessed with meditation, philosophy, energy, chakras, enlightenment, suffering, self, and religion through basically all of my teen years. I've been working towards stream entry. I find myself mostly between A&amp;P stuff, dark night stuff, and poking through to equanimity. Kenneth Folk said that once you cross the A&amp;P, you're on the ride, and you'll make choices to pursue that ride at the expense of other things. I've found this to be extremely true. I'm busy with college, but dharma stuff just takes over my mind. More and more, I'm losing the will and desire to do homework that I see as pointless. I see rigid systems and unenlightened, unhappy people trying to explain what true happiness and success is, along with fellow classmates, turning from interest in the beauty of life, to stress of work, obsession of money, and a cold, almost manic attempt to tune out anything spiritual, philosophical, or suggestive of inner-peace, happiness, bliss, joy, that kind of stuff. I understand the whole A&amp;P excitement and evangelicalism I may exhibit, but this seems different. Before college, these people loved to walk in the woods, speculate about the universe, try meditations, and contemplate the odd, frantic, posession-driven lifestyle led by the adults. Now, there seems to be some sort of cognitive dissonance, where these moments are in opposition to the ideas of success, wealth, power, ""making it big"". It makes me feel like I'm not growing up, like I'm somehow less mature, somehow less directed, somehow less successful, somehow less intelligent. This is reinforced by knowing that my parents have been talking to my sister in private, telling her that they don't think I'm going to succeed in school, don't think I'm going to find any work, don't think I'm trying, don't think I'm taking it seriously, don't think about anyone but myself. These are terrible things to hear, and they add up to, ""we don't believe in you or feel supportive of your life"". If they really cared, wouldn't they try to talk to me about it? 

My parents are paying me through college. I've offered to pay but they have said that they want to pay. I've only attended two semesters, but to be fair, I tested out and substituted free college for high school for my junior and senior years of high school, accumulating over a year's worth of credits. As I grow more and more uncertain that college is doing something for me, I worry that the longer I keep attending, the longer I waste my parents' money. The urge to drop out is strong and growing, and I worry that if I don't do it now, they'll be thousands of dollars more upset if I decide to do it down the road, or end up pursuing something other than a career in my degree-field.  

There's the dharma thing too. I'm under the impression that if I get stream-entry, I am likely to rid myself of a lot of suffering, remove a lot of the pain of self-referencing, and have a much more stable position to make life decisions from. The problem is, that I feel as though I don't have time to get the momentum to get stream entry. I'm busy paying attention to lectures, to studying and practising. I've heard of people getting stream entry at home or at work, and I suppose it's possible to get it, but I just have the feeling that I can't build up enough momentum to do it. I note when I get up and go to school, but it's just impossible to pay attention to notes during lectures and homework, and impossible to pay attention to lectures and homework during noting. Sometimes I get home and fall asleep in the evening, exhausted, and don't get up until the next day, then do it all again. Sometimes the dukkha nanas will come on so strong that I fell as though I can't make it to the end of a hallway without stopping and trying to find stability. Doing homework in intense misery is an impossibility. I fall apart upon the work. Then, there's the emotional pain and insecurity that I encounter so often with my mum, which is also hard to deal with during dukkha. I've tried to avoid bleed-through but the bottom line is, my effort seems to not have been enough, since I'm failing two classes and not really making any new progress in insight.   


I also have to consider this. Is my disenchantment with the life I'm living truly just because of the dukkha nanas? Will my concerns with the system of college just disappear once I get stream entry? Will I just be like, ""Oh, its all okay now and I can do this without worrying about the stuff I used to""? I am only speculating, but I don't think the concern will just disappear. Perhaps someone has experience here.   


Based on all of this, I'm considering deferring schooling, heading off to a monastery where I can focus all my efforts on stream entry and possibly beyond, and then deciding from that point what would be best to do with my life. I don't know though. I don't really have anyone to talk to about all this. I've thought of contacting various monasteries and seeing if there is anyone who would have this conversation. "
